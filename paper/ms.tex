\begin{abstract}
  Recent studies of stars in open clusters have shown how the rotation
  rates and lithium content of FGK stars evolve during the first few
  billion years of their lives.
  %
  Here we apply this knowledge to stars observed by the primary Kepler
  mission in order to derive rotation and lithium-based ages.
  %
  Rotation periods are drawn from previous Kepler analyses; lithium is
  measured from new and archival HIRES spectra.
  %
  We report rotation-based ages for \nuniqstarsantosrotgyroappl\ stars
  and \nplwgyroagenograzing\ planets for which we believe
  gyrochronology is valid;
  these rotation-based ages are $\approx$15-20$\times$ more precise
  than isochrone ages for our sample of FGK stars.
  %
  While the independent lithium and rotation-based ages agree
  for $\approx$90\% of stars, the timescales of lithium depletion are
  such that rotation is the more precise age diagnostic for the
  majority of our stellar sample.
  %
  Our resulting catalog of planetary ages includes
  \nplyounggyrotwosigma\ planets younger than 1\,Gyr at 2$\sigma$
  (\nplyounggyrothreesigma\ planets at 3$\sigma$).
  %
  For both planet-hosts, and for the broader sample of stars in the
  Kepler field, we find that the stellar age distribution decreases
  linearly from 3\,Gyr ago to present day, implying a linearly
  decreasing star formation rate.
  %
  While this parent stellar age distribution has implications for the
  star formation history of our Galaxy, it also bounds the relative
  balance of young and old planets detectable using both Kepler and
  also future wide-field transit surveys.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Exoplanet science is in an age of abundance, fueled by the discovery
of thousands of worlds orbiting close to their host stars
\citep{Borucki10,2015JATIS...1a4003R}.
Most of these exoplanets have ages comparable to that of the solar
system.
This fact leaves many gaps in our knowledge of the exact dynamical and
physical processes that produce these objects.
Finding and characterizing young ($<$1\,Gyr) exoplanets offers
one possible workaround.
The reason is that processes such as thermal cooling
\citep{2007ApJ...659.1661F}, atmospheric loss
\citep{2019AREPS..47...67O}, giant impacts
\citep{2014prpl.conf..595R}, and dynamical instability
\citep{2017MNRAS.470.1750I} are expected to over $\approx$10\,Myr to
$\approx$1\,Gyr timescales, and so they may leave observable imprints
in the properties of young planets.
Individual exemplars include V1298~Tau \citep{David_2019}, an
adolescent resonant chain of four transiting puffy planets, and
HIP~67522 \citep{Rizzuto_2020}, a Jupiter-sized planet with a
Neptunian mass (Thao et al.~submitted).
% And perhaps also TOI837, now with a uber massive core!
Population-level examples include tentative differences in the size
distribution of young planets relative to their older counterparts
\citep{Berger_2020b_rpage,David_2021,Sandoval_2021,2023AJ....166..248C,2024arXiv240303261V}.

Discovering a young planet requires solving two problems: find the
planet, and measure the star's age.  Each problem admits a range of
solutions.  Here, we will focus on planets previously found using
transits, and infer new stellar ages using rotation and lithium.
Rotation will provide the most age information for the largest number
of stars.  Lithium will provide useful information for
stars younger than a few hundred million years.

To begin, let us imagine that the age distribution of stars within a
few hundred parsecs of the Sun is uniform between 0 and 10\,Gyr
\citep[e.g.][]{Nordstrom_2004}.  This approximation is useful because
it clarifies the rarity of young stars: under these assumptions,
$\approx$1\% of nearby stars have $t$$<$100\,Myr, and $\approx$10\%
have $t$$<$1\,Gyr.  Studies of forming protoplanetary
\citep{2018A&A...617A..44K}, and of exoplanets evolving shortly after
disk dispersal \citep[e.g.][]{2022MNRAS.512.5067K}, are therefore
capped in their maximum achievable sample sizes by the tyranny of the
Galactic star formation rate.

%TODO mention the RV approach?  at least the Hyades etc work...

Despite the observational restrictions, young close-in planet
discovery has seen remarkable success over the past decade.
This has been enabled by a combination of Kepler, K2, TESS, and Gaia
\citep[e.g.][]{Meibom_2013,Mann_K2_25_2016,Mann_2017,Curtis_2018,Livingston_2018,David_2019,Bouma_2020_toi837,Rizzuto_2020,Plavchan_2020,Newton_2021,Nardiello_2022,Tofflemire_2021,Barber_2022,Bouma_2022a,Bouma_2022b,Zhou_2022,Zakhozhay_2022,Wood_2023}.
The original strategy from around 2010 to 2020 was to focus on stars
with known ages---obvious members of open clusters---and to search
them for transiting planets.  
The resulting stellar ages are precise at the $\approx$10\% level, and
planets discovered in this way are generally assumed to have the same
age as the host cluster.  
A more recent development, facilitated by the second Gaia data
release, is the idea that finding transiting planets can often be
easier than finding and characterizing the host stellar association.

Despite recent advances, the main problem with any ``cluster-first'' approach is that
only $\approx$1\% of stars within the nearest few hundred parsecs can
currently be associated with their birth cluster, even using the Gaia
data
\citep[e.g.][]{Zari_2018,CantatGaudin_2020,Kounkel_2020,Kerr_2021}.
In other words, the majority of nearby sub-gigayear stars are in the
field, and are omitted by cluster-only planet searches.  
%TODO FIXME: is this rhetorical point fair?
One can appreciate the problem by querying NASA's Exoplanet Archive
for transiting planets younger than 1\,Gyr.
Imposing reasonable precision requirements, e.g. either $t$$<$1\,Gyr
at 2$\sigma$, or else requiring ages precise to say S/N$=$3, gives $\approx$50 ``young'' transiting planets at the time of writing.
Most of these planets are in clusters, and have been discovered by Kepler, K2, or TESS.  
However, combined, these surveys have discovered
$\approx$5{,}000 planets.  Barring a major discovery bias, we
would expect an order of magnitude more transiting 
planets to be younger than 1\,Gyr, based on our earlier order of
magnitude reasoning.

This study aims to resolve two main issues.
First, there is the question of how wrong it is to assume a uniform age
distribution for stars in the galactic thin disk, particularly young stars.
Second, there is the question of which planets from the main Kepler
mission are actually young.

Given that Kepler's primary mission ended in 2013, one might be forgiven for
assuming that the ages of the Kepler planets are already known.
Of course, they have been studied:
\citeauthor{Berger_2020b_rpage} and \citeauthor{Petigura_2022} for instance calculated
isochronal ages for individual stars, which is most
precise for stars whose luminosities and temperatures separate them
from the main-sequence.
\citeauthor{David_2021} leveraged
both isochronal ages from an earlier analogous study
\citep{Fulton_Petigura_2018_cks_vii}, and, in their core analysis, this work used a
relative gyrochrone age-ranking approach that sorted stars based on
whether they rotated faster or slower than a gyrochrone age of
$\approx$2.6\,Gyr \citep{Meibom_2015,Curtis_2020}.
These studies were conducted in the broader context of investigating
trends in exoplanet demographics, which have been shown to depend on
both stellar metallicity and mass \citet{Petigura_2018}, at levels
likely stronger than age (at least over gigayear timescales).
However, these studies offered limited sensitivity to the ages of the youngest
planets, due to the limitations of isochronal dating.

%      and \citet{Petigura_2022} have reported trends between small-planet
%      occurrence and both stellar metallicity and mass; these parameters
%      seem, at first glance, to be more important predictors of bulk changes
%      in the planetary population than age.  Given these known correlations,
%      it can be useful to consider population models in which variables such
%      as metallicity, mass, and age are added in succession
%      \citep[e.g.][]{Thorngren_2021}.  An alternative, and perhaps more
%      rigorous approach, is to jointly infer the number of planets per star
%      as a function of both planetary and stellar parameters, the latter
%      including age \citep[e.g.][]{2023AJ....166..209M}.



%     While the youngest 0.1\% of stars ($\lesssim$10\,million
%     years; Myr) are perhaps the most constraining for studies of planet
%     formation, they are extremely challenging targets for close-in
%     exoplanet detection 
%     \citep[see e.g.][]{Damasso_2020,Bouma_2020_ptfo,Donati_2020}.  Studies of
%     the early orbital, structural, and atmospheric evolution of exoplanets
%     are perhaps most technically feasible for the 
%     $\approx$1\% of stars
%     with ages between 10 and 100\,Myr, or perhaps even the 10\% of stars
%     younger than 1\,Gyr.  However, since stellar ages are roughly
%     uniformly distributed in the solar neighborhood, there is a limit on
%     the sample size of young planets that will be detectable in these age
%     regimes, particularly relative to their older breathren.

%      Theoretical predictions for planet evolution in the Kepler sample are
%      most important in the context of mini-Neptunes and super-Earths, since
%      these are the most abundant planets.  Pertinent predictions include:
%      {\it a)} that mini-Neptunes should cool and contract, roughly
%      following a $R_p \propto t^{-0.1}$ scaling \citep{Gupta_2019}; {\it
%      b)} that large and close-in mini-Neptunes at the edge of the
%      photoevaporation desert should shrink over the atmospheric loss
%      timescale, $t_{\rm loss}$ \citep{Owen_Lai_2018}; {\it c)} that the
%      abundance of 4-8\,R$_\oplus$ planets with masses of 5-30\,M$_\oplus$
%      should decrease over $t_{\rm loss}$---the upper-envelope of the
%      mini-Neptune size distribution should corresponding decrease,
%      e.g.~from $\approx$4.5\,R$_\oplus$ at $\approx$200\,Myr to
%      $\approx$3.5\,R$_\oplus$ at $\approx$700\,Myr
%      \citep[e.g.][]{Rogers_2021}; {\it d)} that the super-Earth to
%      mini-Neptune ratio, $\theta$, should increase over $t_{\rm loss}$
%      \citep[e.g.][]{Rogers_2021}, with the mini-Neptune abundance
%      decreasing by at least a factor of two or three, and the super-Earth
%      abundance increasing in tandem; {\it e)} that the
%      upper boundary of the super-Earth population should increase over the
%      same timescale as $\theta$ is increasing, since more massive
%      super-Earth cores should be able to retain their envelopes for longer
%      than less massive cores.
%      
%      The details of the predictions are flexible, in that they depend on
%      the distributions of planetary core masses, initial atmospheric mass
%      fractions, and initial entropies of the atmospheres after disk
%      dispersal.  For instance, different sources of heating---from the star
%      \citep{Owen_Wu_2013,Lopez_Fortney_2014,Jin_2014}, planetary interior
%      \citep{Gupta_2019}, or even giant impacts
%      \citep{Biersteker_Schlichting_2019}---can produce very different
%      histories for the size evolution of planets at these early times
%      \citep[e.g.][]{Owen_2020}.  Different internal compositions also alter
%      the predicted size evolution \citep[e.g.][]{2024NatAs.tmp...33B}.  The
%      generic prediction that the ``upper envelope'' of the mini-Neptune
%      size distribution should shrink due to Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling is
%      hard to avoid; predictions however concerning the ``radius valley''
%      and movement of planets across it are dependent on the timescales and
%      prevalence of atmospheric mass loss.  In specific scenarios for
%      initial atmospheric accretion \citep{Lee_2022} and early atmospheric
%      evolution \citep{2024MNRAS.529.2716R} the radius gap might form
%      without needing to invoke post-disk dispersal mass loss at all.  In
%      such scenarios, there could be very little evolution of the planetary
%      size distribution between 1 and 4\,\rearth\ over the first gigayear.
%      
%      Can stellar age measurements provide evidence for or against
%      these different models?  Neither {\it (a)} nor {\it (b)} has yet had a
%      convincing---or even suggestive--- detection reported (see
%      \citealt{Petigura_2022}).  While an apparent over-abundance of large
%      very young planets ({\it (c)}) has been noted by multiple authors
%      \citep[e.g.][]{2017AJ....153...64M,Bouma_2020}, its presence is almost certainly
%      exacerbated by a selection effect against sub-Neptune sized planet
%      detection at $<$100\,Myr \citep{Zhou_2021,Bouma_2022b}.  Recent studies have
%      nonetheless found that when accounting for completeness, there is
%      $\approx$3$\sigma$ evidence that hot mini-Neptunes are more prevalent in
%      $\approx$100-500\,Myr old K2 \citep{2023AJ....166..248C} and TESS
%      \citep{2024arXiv240303261V} stars than in the older Kepler sample
%      \citep[e.g.][]{2020AJ....159..248K}.
%      %TODO: more kepler citations...
%      
%      Regarding the observed mini-Neptune to super-Earth ratio, {\it (d)} and {\it
%      (e)} were explored by \citet{Berger_2020b_rpage} and the twin
%      \citet{David_2021} and \citet{Sandoval_2021} studies.  Both
%      \citet{Berger_2020b_rpage} and \citet{Sandoval_2021} reported that $\theta$
%      increases with time, at a statistical significance of $\approx$2-3$\sigma$.
%      For \citet{Berger_2020b_rpage}, this conclusion was reached by comparing the
%      sizes of 85 planets with median isochronal ages younger than 1\,Gyr with a
%      property-matched sample of planets older than 1\,Gyr.  In
%      \citet{Sandoval_2021}, the conclusion was reached by computing the ratio while
%      performing a Monte Carlo re-sampling procedure from the isochronal ages and
%      planetary sizes computed by \citet{Fulton_Petigura_2018_cks_vii}.  Finally,
%      effect {\it (e)} was reported by \citet{David_2021}, who found that the average
%      location of the radius valley shifted from $\approx$1.8\,R$_\oplus$ to
%      $\approx$2.0\,R$_\oplus$ between 1.8 and 3.2\,Gyr.
%      
%      The fact that stellar ages---and especially isochronal ages---are
%      correlated with stellar masses and metallicities is a source of stress
%      for many in this subfield.  \citet{Sandoval_2021} for instance noted a
%      strong trend in $\theta$ as a function of stellar metallicity in
%      addition to the trend they noted in age, and cautioned that this could
%      also explain their observations.  Independently, \citet{Petigura_2018}
%      and \citet{Petigura_2022} have reported trends between small-planet
%      occurrence and both stellar metallicity and mass; these parameters
%      seem, at first glance, to be more important predictors of bulk changes
%      in the planetary population than age.  Given these known correlations,
%      it can be useful to consider population models in which variables such
%      as metallicity, mass, and age are added in succession
%      \citep[e.g.][]{Thorngren_2021}.  An alternative, and perhaps more
%      rigorous approach, is to jointly infer the number of planets per star
%      as a function of both planetary and stellar parameters, the latter
%      including age \citep[e.g.][]{2023AJ....166..209M}.  Such analyses are
%      most effective when the measurement precision of these different
%      parameters is as high as possible.

Gyrochronology offers ages precise to $\lesssim$30\% for FGK stars
between 0.5-4\,Gyr, and can also provide useful age limits at earlier
times \citep{Bouma_2023}.  The idea of using a star's spin-down as a
clock is quite old
\citep{Skumanich_1972,Noyes_1984,Kawaler_1989,Barnes03,Mamajek_2008,Angus_2015},
and physics-based models for the spin-down itself can clarify many
aspects of how the stellar winds, internal structure, and magnetic
dynamo all evolve
\citep[e.g.][]{Matt_2015,Gallet_Bouvier_2015,Spada_2020}.  Today
however, measurements of stellar rotation periods in open clusters
provide the most accurate empirical calibrations of rotation-based
ages (\citealt{Bouma_2023}, and references therein).  This approach
ultimately ties the rotation age scale to the cluster age scale, and
is limited in precision by the intrisic scatter in the $P_{\rm rot}$
sequences, and in accuracy by systematic uncertainties in the evolving
spin-down rates, and in the cluster ages themselves.  The oldest
cluster for which this method has been calibrated is currently M67
\citep[$\approx$4\,Gyr][]{2022ApJ...938..118D}.

Lithium ages includes two qualitatively distinct regimes: depletion
boundary ages derived for M-dwarfs in star clusters, and the less
precise decline-based ages for individual field FGK stars
\citep{Soderblom_2010}.  Here we focus on the latter approach, which
relies on the observation that the Li abundances of
partially-convective stars gradually decline as they age
\citep[e.g.][]{2005A&A...442..615S}.  The theoretical explanation for
this decline is debated
\citep[e.g.][]{1995ApJ...441..865C,2010ApJ...716.1269D,2019MNRAS.485.4052C}
Empirical understanding has however recently improved due to the work
by \citet{Jeffries_2023}, who built a model for how the equivalent
width (EW) of the \ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet evolves as a function
of stellar effective temperature and age for a set of 6{,}200 stars in
52 open clusters.  Two-sided lithium ages are useful for Kepler (FGK)
stars between $\approx$0.03-0.5\,Gyr, with a strong dependence on
spectral type since the K-dwarfs lose their surface lithium much
faster than G-dwarfs.  The precision of the ages reported by the
\citet{Jeffries_2023} method in this regime are in the range of
0.3-0.5~dex.

We discuss our methods for selecting stellar and planetary samples in
Section~\ref{sec:selection}, and describe
the origin of our adopted stellar parameters other than ages in
Section~\ref{sec:stellarprops}.
We describe and validate our age-dating methods in
Sections~\ref{sec:rotage} and~\ref{sec:liage}.
The population-level trends for both the parent stellar sample and
the planet sample are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
A few conclusions are offered in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

This work is focused on Kepler stars for which ages can be inferred
using either rotation, lithium, or both.  These ``age-dateable
stars'' are a minority of the \nkeplerstars\ Kepler targets.  Rotation
periods have been reported for roughly one in three Kepler targets
\citep[e.g.][]{McQuillan_2014,Santos_2021}.  High-resolution spectra,
which can yield measurements of the \ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet, 
have only been acquired for the Kepler objects of interest
(KOIs), which comprise a few percent of Kepler's targets.
In the following, we will describe the set of stars that we
adopt with measured rotation periods (Section~\ref{subsec:rotsel}),
the set of objects we adopt as planets
(Section~\ref{subsec:planetsel}), and the set of planets with
high-resolution spectra suitable for lithium analysis
(Section~\ref{subsec:lithiumsel}).


\subsection{Stellar Rotation Periods}
\label{subsec:rotsel}

To select stars with rotation periods, we turn to previous work.
Studies of stellar rotation across the entire Kepler field include
those by \citet{McQuillan_2014} (\citetalias{McQuillan_2014}),
\citet{Reinhold_2015}, \citet{Santos_2019} (\citetalias{Santos_2019}),
and \citet{Santos_2021} (\citetalias{Santos_2021}).
\citetalias{McQuillan_2014} used an approach based on the
autocorrelation function to detect 34{,}030 rotation periods for
main-sequence Kepler targets cooler than 6500\,K, and excluded known
eclipsing binaries and KOIs.  \citet{Reinhold_2015} used an iterative
Lomb-Scargle based approach to analyze $\approx$40{,}000 stars with a
variability range $R_{\rm var}>0.3$\% that were not known EBs, planet
candidates, or pulsators; they reported primary rotation periods for
24{,}124 of these stars.  \citet{Reinhold_2015} also reported
secondary periods for two thirds of the stars with primary periods,
which could be caused by differential rotation or finite spot
lifetimes.  Finally, \citetalias{Santos_2019} and
\citetalias{Santos_2021} combined a wavelet analysis and
autocorrelation-based approach, and cumulatively reported rotation
periods for 55{,}232 main-sequence and subgiant FGKM stars.
\citetalias{Santos_2019} and \citetalias{Santos_2021} included known
KOIs and binaries, and assigned them specific quality flags.  The
rotation periods of KOIs have received considerable additional
scrutiny
\citep[e.g.][]{Walkowicz_2013,Mazeh_2015,Angus_2018,David_2021}.

We choose to adopt the results of \citetalias{Santos_2019} and
\citetalias{Santos_2021} as our default rotation periods.
\citetalias{Santos_2021} provides a detailed comparison against
\citetalias{McQuillan_2014}; the brief summary is that the periods
agree for 99.0\% of the 31{,}038 period detections in common between
the two studies.  \citetalias{Santos_2021} classified the 2{,}992
remaining stars from \citetalias{McQuillan_2014} as not showing
rotation periods based on updated knowledge of contaminants
(e.g.~giant stars and eclipsing binaries) and visual inspection.  In
addition, \citetalias{Santos_2021} report rotation periods for
24{,}182 main-sequence and subgiant FGKM stars that were not reported
as periodic by \citetalias{McQuillan_2014}.  Many of these reported
detections have lower variability amplitudes, and longer periods, than
those reported by \citetalias{McQuillan_2014}.  A relevant flag for
stars missing \citetalias{McQuillan_2014} periods is included in
Table~\ref{tab:stars}.  Reviewing the resulting
period detections, we learned that 32 KOIs with orbital and rotation
periods within $\approx$20\% were excluded from the
\citetalias{Santos_2019} and \citetalias{Santos_2021} catalogs
(A.~Santos, priv.~comm.); we choose to include these
objects.\footnote{In general, excluding stars in this category would
impose a bias against young close-in planets, due to the natural
commensurability between the rotation rates of young stars, and
Kepler's increased sensitivity to short-period objects.  While some of
these KOIs are known false positives, our analysis naturally excludes
such objects at later steps.  As one motivating example, this subset
of stars happens to include {\it e.g.}~Kepler~1643 (KIC~8653134), with
$P_{\rm orb}$=5.34\,days and $P_{\rm rot}$=5.05\,days, which is known
to be $\approx$40\,Myr old based on membership in RSG-5
\citep{Bouma_2022b}.  } The final tally of stars from
\citetalias{Santos_2019}, \citetalias{Santos_2021}, and our corrected
KOI list is \nuniqstarsantosrot\ Kepler stars with rotation periods.

%  %TODO is it?
%  We verified that the main conclusions of our analysis do not change if
%  we were to adopt only the periods from \citetalias{McQuillan_2014}.
%  %TODO have you?

As a sanity check on the statistical uncertainties of these rotation
periods, we compared our adopted \citetalias{Santos_2019} and
\citetalias{Santos_2021} periods with those reported by
\citet{McQuillan_2014} and \citet{Mazeh_2015}.  We found that for
$P_{\rm rot}\lesssim$15\,days, the two datasets agree at a precision
of $\lesssim$0.01$P_{\rm rot}$.  At longer periods of $P_{\rm
rot}\approx$30\,days, the agreement was typically at the
$\lesssim$0.03$P_{\rm rot}$ level, and the upper envelope of the
period difference increased roughly linearly with period.  Based on
this comparison, we adopted a simple prescription for the period
uncertainties, such that there are 1\% relative uncertainties below
$P_{\rm rot}=15$\,days, and a linear increase thereafter, with slope
set to guarantee 3\% $P_{\rm rot}$ uncertainties at rotation periods
of 30 days.


\subsection{Kepler Objects of Interest}
\label{subsec:planetsel}

We considered planets in the NASA Exoplanet Archive's cumulative KOI
table, which included the best knowledge available on any given planet
candidate as of 6 June 2023, while also incorporating human-based
vetting.\footnote{See
\url{https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/PurposeOfKOITable.html}}
These planets represent a superset of those in the fully automated
Q1-Q17 DR25 KOI Table \citep{Thompson_2018}, which could be adopted in
future work for planet occurrence rate calculations.  This version of
the cumulative KOI table included \nkoisnofp\ objects that are either
``confirmed'' or ``candidate'' planets, after excluding known false
positives. 

%Crossmatching the Q1-Q17 DR25 KOI table against our stars with
%rotation periods yields \nkoiswithprot\ KOIs with rotation periods, of
%which \nkoisnofpwithprot\ are not known false postives.  These objects
%will comprise the core data for our gyrochronology analysis.

\subsection{High Resolution Spectra}
\label{subsec:lithiumsel}

The final piece of our analysis involves assessing ages based on the
equivalent width of the \ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet.  Specifically,
we analyzed spectra acquired with the High Resolution Echelle
Spectrometer (HIRES; \citealt{vogt_hires_1994}) on the Keck I 10m
telescope.  These spectra were primarily collected through the
California Kepler Survey
\citep{2017AJ....154..107P,2017AJ....154..108J,2017AJ....154..109F}.
We supplemented the existing archive with $\approx$10~hours of new
observations for 22 stars between Fall 2022 and Spring 2024.  These
stars were chosen to ensure that confirmed planets with rotational
evidence for ages below 1\,Gyr had spectra, since this is the age
range in which lithium is most likely to yield useful age constraints.

% stat from _estimate_new_lithium_timefrac.py
Lithium equivalent widths and abundances for the Kepler Objects of
Interest were already analyzed by \citet{2018ApJ...855..115B} for
about three quarters of the spectra in our sample.  However, since new
spectra have been acquired since the \citeauthor{2018ApJ...855..115B}
analysis, and since our approach and selection function are different,
we opt to perform our own analysis of the reduced HIRES spectra.

We queried the internal CPS archive to collect all blaze-corrected
HIRES spectra that were available for all non-false positive Kepler
Objects of Interest with a MES$>$10.  This query yielded at least one
spectrum for \nlithiumstars\ stars and \nlithiumplanets\ planets.  For
stars with multiple spectra available at varying ranges of
signal-to-noise (S/N), we analyzed only the spectrum with the highest
number of counts.  The resulting spectra were acquired between 6
September 2009 and 16 May 2024, and cumulatively comprise
\nhireshours\,hours of open-shutter time.

We measured the lithium equivalent widths using a procedure
adapted from previous work \citep{Bouma_2021}.  Our stars of interest
are FGK stars, and so the continuum in the vicinity of the \ion{Li}{1}
6708\,\AA\ doublet is well-defined.  We Doppler corrected the spectra
to a common reference wavelength by cross-correlating against a high
S/N template for Kepler-1698, chosen because $\gamma$$\approx$9\kms,
$T_{\rm eff}$$\approx$5000\,K and $v\sin i$$\approx$5\,\kms, which
puts it in the middle of our sample's temperature range and gives it
mild line-broadening.  We then trimmed the Doppler-corrected spectra
to a local window centered on the lithium line, using a window width
of 15\,\AA\ (we considered 10\,\AA\ and 20\,\AA; the results were
broadly consistent).  We continuum-normalized by fitting a
third-degree Chebyshev series, while excluding regions with
absorption lines.  We then numerically integrated the resulting
spectrum using a one-component Gaussian with free amplitude, width,
and mean, and estimated uncertainties on the line width through a
Monte Carlo procedure that bootstraped against the local scatter in
the continuum.

Our EW measurement approach does not correct for the neighboring
\ion{Fe}{1} 6707.44\,\AA\ blend.  To evaluate the accuracy and
precision of our equivalent measurement technique, after applying an
initial iteration on the \nlithiumstars\ KOIs with spectra, we
compared our lithium equivalent widths with those reported by
\citet{2018ApJ...855..115B}.  For the \nbergeroverlap\ stars in both
samples, we found broad agreement at $>$30\,m\AA, and significant
differences at $<$30\,m\AA because \citet{2018ApJ...855..115B}
required positive EWs, while we allow for negative ones.  At
$>$30\,m\AA, there is however a small offset in our respective
scales, such that (B24-B18)$=$7.50$\pm$8.55\,m\AA.  This offset is
caused by our non-treatment of the iron blend.  We therefore directly
subtract the constant mean value noted above when calculating
lithium-based ages.




\section{Stellar Properties}
\label{sec:stellarprops}

% https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR3/Data_analysis/chap_cu8par/sec_cu8par_apsis/ssec_cu8par_apsis_gspphot.html

Our default source for stellar temperatures and surface gravities is
the Gaia-Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog (GKSP;
\citealt{Berger_2020a_catalog}).  The GKSP parameters were reported
for stars with ``AAA'' 2MASS photometry, measured parallaxes in Gaia
DR2,  and $g$-band photometry from either the KIC or the Kepler-INT
survey.  The parameters themselves were derived using
\texttt{isoclassify} \citep{2017ApJ...844..102H} to interpolate over
the MIST isochrone grids
\citep{2016ApJ...823..102C,2016ApJS..222....8D}, given the SDSS $g$
and 2MASS $K_{\rm s}$ photometry, the Gaia DR2 parallaxes, and
$V$-band extinction from the \citet{2018MNRAS.478..651G} reddening
map.  The resulting stellar parameters are available for
\fracstarswithprotwithbtwenty\ of the \nuniqstarsantosrot\ Kepler
stars with rotation periods.  For the remaining
\fracstarswithprotwithoutbtwenty\ of stars that lack temperatures and
surface gravities from \citetalias{Berger_2020a_catalog}, we adopt the
values reported by \citet{Santos_2019} and \citet{Santos_2021}, which
for these cases primarily derive from the \citet{Mathur_2017} DR25
Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog, and are mostly derived from
photometry.  In the planet sample, \frackoisnofpwithprotwithbtwenty\
of the non-false-positive KOIs with rotation periods have parameters
from \citet{Berger_2020a_catalog}, and the remainder similarly are
drawn from DR25. 

\citet{David_2021} compared the photometric
\citetalias{Berger_2020a_catalog} stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$,
$R_\star$, [Fe/H]) against the spectroscopic parameters from
\citet{Fulton_2018}.  The temperature scales did show a few-percent
systematic difference, with \citetalias{Fulton_2018} quoting higher
temperatures than \citetalias{Berger_2020a_catalog} for mid K dwarfs,
and lower temperatures for early F dwarfs.  Our age analysis,
described below, assumes Gaussian uncertainties in effective
temperatures; we by default adopt the maximum of the two-sided
uncertainties reported by \citetalias{Berger_2020a_catalog} as our
symmetric temperature uncertainty.  Overall, the impact of systematic
uncertainties in the temperature scale on our age uncertainties is
generally smaller than that of the intrinsic scatter in the
calibration sequences of the open clusters.

\section{Ages From Rotation}
\label{sec:rotage}

We calculate gyrochrone ages using \texttt{gyro-interp}
\citep{Bouma_2023}, which is a method designed to address the issue
that, especially over the first gigayear of stellar spin-down, stars
with the same mass and same rotation period can have very different
ages \citep[e.g.][]{Curtis_2019_ngc6811}.  The gyrochrone age
posterior should therefore incorporate this intrinsic population-level
scatter into the precision with which the age can be inferred.
Figure~\ref{fig:models} highlights this problem, particularly in
regions where the 0.1-1\,Gyr stars overlap.

Using our adopted effective temperatures and rotation periods, we ran
\texttt{gyro-interp} over an age grid of 0 to 4\,Gyr, linearly spaced
over 500 grid points.  \texttt{gyro-interp} itself is calibrated out
to 4\,Gyr, the age of M67
\citep[see][]{2022ApJ...938..118D,Gruner_2023}.  To estimate the
stellar spin-down rate as a function of time and stellar temperature,
the framework interpolates between reference open clusters using
smooth cubic hermite polynomials.  We calculate the probability of the
rotation-based age $t_{\rm gyro}$, given the observed rotation
periods, effective temperatures, and their uncertainties by
integrating Equation~1 of \citet{Bouma_2023} at the default grid
resolution.  This procedure marginalizes over the intrinsic age and
temperature dependent scatter that is observed in the cluster
sequences to yield statistical age uncertainties.


\subsection{Gyrochronology Quality Flags}
\label{subsec:flags}
We calculated gyrochrone age posteriors for all
\nuniqstarsantosrotteffcut\ stars with reported rotation periods and
effective temperatures between 3800\,K and 6200\,K.  To flag stars for
which we suspect these ages may not in fact be valid, we built a set
of bit-quality flags.  When and how these flags should be applied
depends on the question being asked.  If the goal is to construct a
false-positive free sample, they might all be applied.  If the goal is
to construct a complete sample of young stars, then consider the
examples of Kepler~1627Ab ($\approx$40\,Myr) and Kepler~51c
($\approx$625\,Myr).  The former has a high RUWE due to a resolved
binary companion \citep{Bouma_2022a}; the latter is on a grazing orbit
\citep{2014ApJ...783...53M}.  Our gyrochronology quality flag, $Q_{\rm
gyro}$, enables selecting for or against such cases by selecting from
the following bits.

As a general philosophy, three assumptions must hold for a
rotation-based age dating method like \texttt{gyro-interp} to be
valid.  {\it 1)} The evolutionary state of the target star must be
well-specified by its temperature and its age, {\it 2)} the star's
spindown must not be influenced by binary companions, and {\it 3)} the
rotation period distribution for field stars of a given temperature
and age must be identical to that of equally aged open clusters
(metallicity differences, for instance, are ignored).  A rephrasing of
the first condition is that the star must be ``near the main
sequence'', because during post main sequence evolution, the
temperatures of stars change.  From $\approx$0.08 to $\approx$3\,Gyr,
the stars of interest in this work (3800--6200\,K,
0.5--1.2\,$M_\odot$) have temperatures constant to $\approx$1\%
\citep{Choi_2016}.  From $\approx$3--4\,Gyr, a 1.2\,$M_\odot$ star's
temperature drops from $\approx$6200\,K to $\approx$6000\,K
($\approx$3\%), because its outer layers expand as it begins hydrogen
shell burning as a subgiant.  We treat this issue in a somewhat
convoluted manner, discussed in ``bit 9'' below.

{\it Temperature range (bit 0)}---We require stars to have effective
temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$ between 3800 and 6200\,K in order to report
gyrochrone ages \citep{Bouma_2023}.   Stars hotter than 6200\,K spin
down very slowly, if at all.  Stars cooler than 3800\,K do spin down
over gigayear timescales
\citep{2016ApJ...821...93N,2023ApJ...954L..50E,2024arXiv240312129C},
but the currently available open cluster data have yet to clarify
exactly when the intrinsic scatter in the population decreases.

{\it Surface gravity (bit 1)}---We flagged stars as possible subgiants
if they had $\log g < 4.2$.  We set this threshold by examining the
relevant flag from \citet{berger_2018_radii_evolnstates},
cross-matched against \citet{Berger_2020a_catalog}.

{\it Absolute luminosity (bit 2)}---We calculated the absolute Gaia
DR3 $G$-band luminosity, ignoring reddening, using the reported
apparent $G$-band magnitude and parallaxes.  We flag stars with
$M_{\rm G} < 3.9$ or $M_{\rm G} > 8.5$, corresponding to main-sequence
spectral types earlier than $\approx$F8V or later than $\approx$M0.5V
\citep{Pecaut_2013}.

{\it Known eclipsing binaries (bit 3)}---We flagged any stars reported
to be in the final Kepler eclipsing binary catalog (KEBC;
\citealt{2016AJ....151...68K}).

{\it Kepler-Gaia crossmatch quality (bits 4 and 5)}--- In situations
where we wanted to leverage Gaia DR3 data, we used M.~Bedell's 4$''$
Kepler-to-Gaia crossmatch\footnote{\url{https://gaia-kepler.fun}, last
accessed 15 April 2024.  We used 4$''$ rather than the 1$''$ match
because 91 KOIs are omitted in the 1$''$ match, 23 of which have
either ``candidate'' or ``confirmed'' status.  Almost all of these 23
are M dwarfs with high proper motions.  Performing the same crossmatch
at 4 arcseconds, only two KOIs (KOI-3993 and KOI-6531), both known
false positives, fail to yield Gaia DR3 crossmatches.}, which is a
crossmatch of the NASA Exoplanet Archive
\texttt{q1\_q17\_dr25\_stellar} catalog with Gaia DR3.  The separation
distribution of the Kepler-Gaia DR3 crossmatches is such that 99.2\%
of candidate matches are within 1$''$.   We nonetheless noted an
upturn in the candidate match rate from 3-4$''$; such sources are
flagged using bit 4.  For KIC stars with multiple potential Gaia
matches within the 4$''$ search radius, we adopted the brightest star
as the default match.  In most such cases this was unambiguous because
there is a large brightness difference between the primary and any
apparent neighbors.  However cases with multiple stars within 4$''$
within $\Delta G$$<$$0.5$\,mag are noted using bit flag 5.  

{\it Gaia DR3 non-single-stars (bit 6)}---The Gaia DR3
\texttt{non\_single\_star} column in the \texttt{gaia\_source} table
flags known eclipsing, astrometric, and spectroscopic binaries.  We
directly include this column.

{\it RUWE (bit 7)}---We inspected diagrams of the Gaia DR3 renormalized
unit weight error
(RUWE) as a function of other stellar parameters, %\footnote{\url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR3/Gaia_archive/chap_datamodel/sec_dm_main_source_catalogue/ssec_dm_gaia_source.html}})
and flag stars with RUWE$>$1.4 as possible binaries.  Such astrometric
outliers can be either bona fide astrometric binaries, or more often
are marginally resolved point sources for which the single-source PSF
model used in the Gaia pipeline induces spurious astrometric scatter.

{\it Crowding (bit 8)}---We searched the Gaia DR3 point source catalog
for stars within 1 Kepler pixel (4$''$) of every target star.  While
many such companions are not physically associated with the target
star, their presence can bias stellar parameters and stellar rotation
period measurements.  We therefore flag any stars with neighbors down
to 10$\times$ the brightness of the target star within this region
($\Delta G < 2.5$).

{\it Near the main-sequence (bit 9)}---Many stars observed by Kepler
are far from the main sequence: this can be seen in color--absolute
magnitude diagrams, and in diagrams of e.g.~surface gravity as a
function of temperature (Figure~\ref{fig:stellarprops}).  This is a
challenge for rotation-based age-dating because {\it i)} point sources
far from the main-sequence include unresolved photometric binaries,
and {\it ii}) effects other than magnetic braking influence the
rotation periods of bona fide single stars far from the main-sequence.
The added complications of reddening and metallicity make defining a
simple cut in any two dimensions challenging.  
We explored various options, and settled on the orange locus in the
$\log g$--$T_{\rm eff}$ plane shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stellarprops}.
While the details of how exactly this locus is constructed are
arbitrary and convoluted,\footnote{In practice, for K dwarfs we fitted an
$N^{\rm th}$-order polynomial to the set of stars for which $t_{\rm
B20,iso}/(+\sigma_{t,{\rm B20,iso}})\approx 3$, where
$t_{\rm B20,iso}$ was the isochronal age reported by
\citet{Berger_2020a_catalog}. We let the order of the fit vary from
$N$=1 to 10, minimized the Bayesian Information Criterion,
and found $N$=6.  For F and G dwarfs, this procedure failed to produce
a reasonable locus because of shifts in the relative precision of
the isochrone ages.  We therefore visually selected KOIs that appeared
to be near the ``main sequence'', fitted a separate polynomial to
their locations, and then stitched the resulting polynomials from the
F and G dwarfs to that of the K dwarfs.} the general 
aim is to exclude stars for which there is photometric evidence
that gyrochronology may not be reliable.  The rotation period
distribution of sources excluded in this manner includes a relatively
larger fraction of ``rapid rotators'' than the main sequence sources,
likely due to a combination of astrophysical and systematic effects.
See for instance Figure~8a of \citet{2022AJ....164..137K} or Figures~12 and 13
of \citet{2023ApJS..268....4F}.


{\it Candidate pulsators and close-in binaries (bit
10)}---\citeauthor{Santos_2021} included in a flag for candidate
``classical pulsators'' (e.g. RR~Lyrae, Cepheids) and candidate
close-in binaries.  Visual inspection of the rotation periods as a
function of temperature shows that although this flag selects many
bona fide objects in these classes, it also selects the overwhelming
majority of $\lesssim$5\,day bona fide young planets.  While we
propagate this flag into our set of quality flags, we therefore
generally ignore it.

{\it How do we use the bit-flags?)}
An important decision for our subsequent analysis is how to combine
the above quality indicators in order to decide whether or not a star is suited for
gyrochronology.  By default, we assume that a star is suitable for
gyrochronology if none of bits zero through nine (inclusive) are
raised.


\subsection{Planet Quality Flags}
\label{subsec:plflags}
For the subset of our analysis that focuses on the properties of
planets, we use the following additional quality indicators to assess 
the quality of a planet, $Q_{\rm planet}$.

% see Erik's 2022 discussion; might want to shift to include a cut on
% disposition score.
{\it Candidate reliability (bit 0)}---no false positives; only
``planet candidates'' and ``confirmed planets''.

{\it Candidate S/N (bit 1)}---the false positive rate increases
greatly toward the noise floor for planet detection in any transit survey \citep[e.g.][]{2002ApJ...564..495J}.  We
required a S/N in excess of Kepler's usual 7.1$\sigma$ floor, through a cut on the
``multiple event statistic'' (MES): we required ${\rm MES}$$>$10.

{\it Grazing planets (bit 2)}---grazing objects ($b$>0.8) often
provide non-robust planetary sizes due to the size-impact parameter
degeneracy.  Particularly for large planets, they can also include
astrophysical false positives at higher rates (due to the same
degeneracy).  While we include a flag for such objects, we by default
do not exclude them from our analysis; this is because...{\bf
justify}.



\subsection{Tally}
\label{subsec:tally}


The rotation periods for the stellar and planetary samples are shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:prot_vs_teff}.  Out of the \nkeplerstars\ stars
observed by Kepler, requiring reported rotation periods and a reliable
DR3 crossmatch yielded \nuniqstarsantosrot\ stars.  Further requiring
these rotating stars to have temperatures 3800$<$$T_{\rm
eff}$/K$<$6200, which is the range over which \texttt{gyro-interp}
returns finite age posteriors, yields \nuniqstarsantosrotteffcut\
stars.  Further requiring them to be apparently single, near the main
sequence, with $\log g$$>$4.2, $M_{\rm G}>3.9$, and not flagged as
eclipsing binaries yielded \nuniqstarsantosallbutruwe\ rotators
potentially amenable for gyrochronology.  Finally, imposing RUWE$<$1.4
and requiring no possible blends ($\Delta G$<2.5) within 4$''$ leaves
\nuniqstarsantosrotgyroappl\ stars for which gyrochronology is likely
to be valid.


In the planet sample, the cumulative KOI table included
\nnonfpcumkois\ confirmed and candidate planets, orbiting
\nnonfpcumkoihosts\ stars.  Assume that we apply all the same stellar
cuts, save for that on RUWE.  Then, require these confirmed and
candidate planets to have MES$>$10.  This combination of selection
criteria yield \nplwgyroagewithgrazingandhighruwe\ planets with
rotation-based ages orbiting
\nplhoststarwgyroagewithgrazingandhighruwe\ stars
(\nplhoststarwgyroagejusthighruwe\ of these stars with ``high'' RUWE).
If we additionally require the planets to be non-grazing ($b<0.8$)
based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits from
\citet{Thompson_2018}, we are left with \nplwgyroagenograzing\ planets and
\nplhoststarwgyroagenograzing\ stars, respectively.




\section{Ages From Lithium}
\label{sec:liage}


Figure~\ref{fig:li_vs_teff} shows our measured lithium equivalent
widths, plotted over the mean isochrone models from
\texttt{EAGLES} \citep{Jeffries_2023}.  We declare an upper-limit for
plotting purposes if ${EW}-\sigma_{\rm EW}$$<$10\,m\AA.  However, our
EWs span -40 to 250\,m\AA; all negative EWs have uncertainties that
are statistically consistent with zero.

To calculate lithium ages, we use \texttt{EAGLES} (git commit
\texttt{ac09637}), which uses a similar method as
\texttt{gyro-interp}, and was calibrated on stars observed by the
Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey in 52 open clusters with ages spanning 2
to 6{,}000\,Myr \citep{Jeffries_2023}.  We adopt a linear prior in
age, spanning $10^6$ to $10^{10}$\,yr, and symmetrize our EW
uncertainties for purposes of interfacing with \texttt{EAGLES} by
taking the maximum of the measured positive and negative 1$\sigma$
uncertainty intervals.
Certain quality flags described in Section~\ref{subsec:flags} are also
relevant for lithium ages, specifically those associated with
crowding and binarity.
For instance, rapid rotators are more common in binaries, and they also
generally have higher lithium abundances than slow-rotating stars of the
same mass (CITE).
Stars for which rotation-based age dating is dubious heavily overlap
with those for which lithium-based ages are dubious.

In part because many of our EWs are upper limits, 
many of the lithium ages are lower limits.
In such cases,  the inferred age posterior is strongly influenced by
{\it i)} the assumed intrinsic dispersion in the lithium model,
and {\it ii)} by the prior.
For instance, 
 we quote the 3$\sigma$ (99.7$^{\rm th}$ percentile) limits.

\subsection{The Demographic Cliff}

Figure~\ref{fig:hist_tgyro} shows the gyrochone age distributions of
stars and planet-hosts in the Kepler field.
We truncated the plots near $3$\,Gyr due to arguments that suggest the
detectability of rotation signals is near-unity up to this age for
Sun-like stars, and decreases for older ages
\citep{2022ApJ...937...94M}.
Both the stellar and planetary samples point toward a star formation
rate in the Kepler field that has slowed over the past few gigayears.
{\it LGB pending words: allude to findings on MW SFH from chemistry,

%

% "Our findings that the thin disc SFH does not follow a sim- ple decreasing shape until the present are in good agreement with Snaith et al. (2015), and Haywood et al. (2016, 2018) who found, using data with metallicities and assuming a fixed IMF, the existence of an SFR quenching followed by a reactivation. Kroupa (2002a), using stellar kinematics, found the SFH to behave similarly. The relative maximum of the SFR that we find at 2–3 Gyr ago is compatible with the results of Vergely et al. (2002) and Cignoni et al. (2006) that, using Hipparcos data in a sphere of 80 pc around the Sun and assuming a fixed IMF, found maximum peaks at 1.75–2 Gyr ago and 2–3 Gyr ago, respec- tively. Recently, Bernard (2018), in a tentative work using TGAS data, pointed towards the existence of a relative maximum also located 2–3 Gyr ago."

Imagine we were to group stars between 0-1\,Gyr, 1-2\,Gyr, and
2-3\,Gyr, and label them ``young'', ``intermediate-age'', and ``old''.
A simple counting exercise from the distributions in
Figure~\ref{fig:hist_tgyro} tells us that there are \ratioobtoybstars\
times as many old stars in the Kepler field as young stars.
Similarly, there are \ratioobtoybplanets\ times as many old planet
hosts as young planet hosts. 

In terms of detected planet counts, our rotation-based ages for
the Kepler sample yield \{\nplyounggyro, \nplmidgyro, \nploldgyro\}
detected planets in the 0-1\,Gyr, 1-2\,Gyr, and 2-3\,Gyr bins.
For the sub-gigayear bin in particular, which holds specific weight in
studies of planet evolution, while there are \nplyounggyro\ planets
with median ages below 1\,Gyr, requiring $t_{\rm
gyro}$$<$1\,Gyr at 2$\sigma$ confidence yields
\nplyounggyrotwosigma\ planets orbiting \nplhostsyounggyrotwosigma\
stars.
The stellar and planetary properties of this latter sample of young
planets are given in Table~\ref{tab:planets}.

Given that the history of young exoplanet discovery includes a
sociological tendency to report detailed descriptions of specific
young exoplanets, we find it necessary to briefly discuss the
properties of at least the most notable members of the set of
confirmed planets that have well-measured ages.
We first focus on systems reported to be in the four stellar
ensembles in the Kepler field that have yielded transiting planets:
Cep-Her, MELANGE-3, Theia~520, and NGC~6811.
We then consider the broader set of Kepler planets that are young
based on the rotational and lithium-based properties of their host
stars.


\subsubsection{Planets in Clusters}
\label{subsec:clusterplanets}

\paragraph{Cep-Her}
Kepler-1627Ab, Kepler-1643b, Kepler-1974b and Kepler-1975\,Ab are
known members of the $\approx$40\,Myr old Cep-Her association
\citep{Bouma_2022a,Bouma_2022b}.  The age of various sub-components of
this association are best measured through relative isochronal
placement of the pre-main-sequence \citep[see][]{Bouma_2022b}, and
gyrochronology of stars in these clusters show them to be $<$100\,Myr
old.  The planets themselves are all on close-in orbits (5-25\,days),
with sizes from 2-4\,$R_\oplus$.  For Kepler-1627A and Kepler-1974,
the rotation, lithium, and cluster-based ages all agree within
1$\sigma$.  For Kepler-1643, while the rotation and cluster ages agree
($46^{+9}_{-7}$\,Myr; \citealt{Bouma_2022b}), the lithium-based age
($198^{+98}_{-76}$\,Myr) is 2.0$\sigma$ above the nominal cluster age
for RSG-5.  For Kepler-1975Ab (KOI\,7913Ab), the lithium age may be
similarly ``old'', though with less confidence due to the large
intrinsic scatter in K dwarf lithium calibration measurements.  For
that system, the isochronal age of its binary companion provides a
more stringent and serendipitous constraint on the $\approx$40\,Myr
age.

\paragraph{MELANGE-3}
\citet{2022AJ....164...88B} described an association in the Kepler
field that was argued to be $105\pm10$\,Myr based on a combination of
rotation, lithium, and the isochronal pre-main-sequence.  Kepler-970
and Kepler-1928 harbor two transiting mini-Neptunes inside this
association \citep{2022AJ....164...88B}.  Our rotation-based
age-dating independently recovers these systems, with $t_{\rm
gyro}=176_{-40}^{+120}$\,Myr and $144_{-88}^{+104}$\,Myr for
Kepler-970 and -1928 respectively.  The former rotation-based age
being slightly older than the suggested Pleiades age for the
assocation agrees with Figure~4 of \citet{2022AJ....164...88B}, where
the MELANGE-3 rotational isochrone is visually slower than
the corresponding Pleiades track.

\paragraph{Theia~520}
Kepler-968 and Kepler-52 both have rotation-based ages of
330-350\,Myr.  These stars were independently reported by
\citet{2019AJ....158..122K} to be members of an association dubbed
Theia~520 based on their spatial and kinematic correlations with
nearby stars.  While the core of this structure was previously named
UBC-1 \citep{2018A&A...618A..59C}, both Kepler planet hosts are in
more diffuse regions of the cluster reported by
\citet{2019AJ....158..122K}, so we adopt the name from the latter
study.  The nominal age of Theia~520 reported by
\citet{2019AJ....158..122K} based on isochrone fitting was
$247^{+64}_{-51}$\,Myr.  An independent analysis of the cluster's core
by \citet{2024A&A...681A..13F} using g-mode asteroseismology,
gyrochronology, and isochrone fitting found consistent results.
Ongoing spectroscopic and rotation-based studies of the broader
cluster by J.~Curtis et al.~ is broadly that the two planet-hosting
stars are indeed members of this diffuse population.  Given the broad
set of both cluster-level and individual-star evidence, this makes
Kepler-968 and Kepler-52 the youngest multiplanet systems that have
currently been identified from the Kepler primary mission.
We leave detailed discussion of the planet's properties to the latter 
group.

\paragraph{NGC~6811}
\citet{Meibom_2013} reported the discovery of Kepler-66 and -67b, two
mini-Neptunes in NGC~6811 ($\approx$1\,Gyr).
We report rotation-based ages for these systems of
$1419^{+657}_{-353}$\,Myr and $873.75\pm{112}$\,Myr respectively.
For Kepler-66, $T_{\rm eff}$=5898\,K, and $P_{\rm
rot}$=10.25$\pm$0.10\,days.

    hosts to have no quality flags raised, and for the planets to
    similarly no have quality flags raised.

	}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Rotation vs.~Lithium Age Comparison}

We judged the consistency of the independent rotation and
lithium-based ages by comparing the point-estimates of the posteriors,
when available.
There are three cases of interest:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Two-sided posteriors available for both $t_{\rm gyro}$ and
    $t_{\rm Li}$: if their values were consistent within
    2$\sigma$, we judged them to be consistent; if they were
    consistent within 2-3$\sigma$, we suggest them to be ``maybe''
    consistent.  Otherwise, they are in disagreement.
\item If $t_{\rm Li}$ is a lower limit, we compare the
  $t_{\rm Li}$ lower limit with the $1\sigma$ upper limit from $t_{\rm
    gyro}$; if the two overlapped, we judge the age estimates to be
    consistent.
\item If $t_{\rm Li}$ provides a two-sided posterior, and no rotation
  is reported, we judge the age estimates to be inconsistent.
  This is because this lithium constraint can only be provided for G and K
  stars $\lesssim$2\,Gyr old, and Kepler should have been sensitive to
  the rotation periods of such stars.
\end{enumerate}

In the entire sample, this yielded 
\allagesyesconsistent\ consistent cases,
\allagesmaybeconsistent\ ``maybe'' cases, and
\allagesnoconsistent\ inconsistent.
Restricting our attention to the $\lesssim$1\,Gyr stars, for which
lithium ages are more constraining,
the respective counts are
\minageltonegyryesconsistent, \minageltonegyrmaybeconsistent, and
\minageltonegyrnoconsistent.
Rephrased, in the overall sample, \fracconsistentallages\%
of stars have consistent rotation and lithium-based ages
(\fracpotentiallyconsistentallages\% potentially consistent).
In the sample of sub-gigayear stars,
\fracconsistentminageltonegyr\% of the ages are
consistent (\fracpotentiallyconsistentminageltonegyr\% potentially
consistent).
We feel it necessary to distinguish ``maybe'' consistent cases because
of lingering uncertainties in how the dispersion of the lithium data
evolve over the first gigayear.
In Appendix~\ref{app:inconsistent}, we discuss the
\minageltonegyrnoconsistent\ discrepant sub-gigayear stars in detail.



\subsubsection{Systems with Rotation and Lithium in Agreement}
%
Whenever both rotation and lithium find a star to be in a
narrowly-constrained age range, confidence in the true age greatly
increases, due to the independence of the two measurement techniques.
The empirical precision for the inferred ages as a function of $P_{\rm
rot}$, $EW_{\rm Li}$, and $T_{\rm eff}$ has been mapped out by
\citet{Bouma_2023} and \citet{Jeffries_2023} for rotation and lithium
respectively.  The region of greatest overlap is dictated by the
timescale for lithium depletion: for stars with temperatures between
4500-5500\,K with ages $\lesssim$500\,Myr, we can hope to obtain
independent two-sided constraints.

The youth of most of these systems, to our knowledge, is being
well-constrained for the first time in this work.  Here we limit
discussion to systems with $t_{\rm gyro}$$<$500\,Myr not in the clusters
mentioned above.

The new young planets
include five 1.8-3.8\,$R_\oplus$ mini-Neptunes
(Kepler-1529b $\approx$100\,Myr,
-1521b $\approx$195\,Myr,
-1467b $\approx$235\,Myr,
-955b $\approx$400\,Myr, and
-523b $\approx$440\,Myr),
a single Neptune-sized planet
(Kepler-971b $\approx$335\,Myr),
five 1.1-1.8\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths
(Kepler-1930b $\approx$150\,Myr,
-1313b $\approx$185\,Myr,
-1565b $\approx$205\,Myr,
-1532b $\approx$400\,Myr,
-1481b $\approx$400\,Myr),
and three Earth or sub-Earth-sized planets
(Kepler-1933b $\approx$300\,Myr,
-1561b $\approx$420\,Myr,
-1482b $\approx$490\,Myr).
All of these planets are on orbital periods below 50\,days.

Of these planets, one specific highlight is Kepler-1933b, a 4.9\,day
1.0\,$R_\oplus$ Earth-sized planet.  Its rotation-based age of
$304^{+96}_{-112}$\,Myr agrees within $1\sigma$ of its lithium age,
though at half the relative uncertainty.  Based on these lines of
evidence, this system may be the youngest Earth-sized planet known,
comparable to systems such as HD~63433d \citep[1.1\,$R_\oplus$,
$414\pm23$\,Myr][]{2024AJ....167...54C}.

A less clear case is Kepler-447b, which is supposedly a 32\,$R_\oplus$
planet on a 7.8\,day grazing orbit.  Rotation and lithium independently
find a 420-440\,Myr age.  {\it LGB TODO What is up with the size?}.

%  Kepler-1529b, a 5.3\,day 2.0\,$R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune is $\approx$100\,Myr old.
%  Kepler-1930b, a 13.0\,day 1.5\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earth on a grazing orbit is $\approx$120-180\,Myr old.

Kepler-1320

\subsubsection{Other Notables}

Kepler~221 is a 633$^{+120}_{-112}$\,Myr four-planet system.

Kepler~51 (CITE Masuda2014) has previously been noted for its bizarre architure.
The rotation-based age we find here is higher/lower than previously noted.

Kepler~411, a $\approx$780$\pm$170\,Myr early K dwarf with three
transiting planets at 3.0, 7.8, and 58\,days, has a rare
architecture.  \citet{2019A&A...624A..15S} conducted a transiting
timing analysis of the system, confirming Kepler-411d and arguing for
the presence of a fourth non-transiting planet, Kepler-411e, based on
the TTVs seen in Kepler-411d and assuming that the system is nearly
coplanar.  Regarding the stellar age, \citet{2019A&A...624A..15S} used
the \citet{2007ApJ...669.1167B} relation and the measured rotation
period, which yielded an estimate of 212$\pm$31\,Myr.  However, the
star's temperature ($\approx$4900\,K) puts it in a regime where the
\citeauthor{2007ApJ...669.1167B} relation has been known to not fit
observations for quite some time
\citep[e.g.][Fig.~9]{2008ApJ...687.1264M}.  Our adopted age of
$\approx$780$\pm$170\,Myr agrees with the open cluster calibrators.

Kepler-63b is interesting in that it is {\it missing} from our
catalog.  This 6.1\,$R_\oplus$ ``sub-Saturn'' has been shown to be in
a polar orbit based on both the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and a
starspot-crossing analysis \citep{2013ApJ...775...54S}.  With $T_{\rm
eff}=5576\pm50$\,K, and a rotation period of 5.40\,days, we calculate
a rotation-based age of $t_{\rm gyro}$=$251^{+80}_{-90}$\,Myr,
qualitatively consistent with the estimates from
\citet{2013ApJ...775...54S}, though with larger uncertainties because
our age accounts for the intrinsic scatter in the open cluster
calibration sequences \citep{Bouma_2023}.  
While the usual catalogs (\citetalias{Santos_2019},
\citetalias{Santos_2021}, \citetalias{McQuillan_2014}, and
\citetalias{Mazeh_2015}) do not report this star's rotation period.
\citetalias{Santos_2021} flagged the system as ``potentially'' having
rotation-based modulation.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

\subsection{``Galactic Archaeology'' Comparison}
Zasowski et al fitted a chemical-isochrone model to APOGEE, X, Y, Z
data and presented a model for the star formation history of the MW.
The gist is a spike at z=2, and a gradual decrease since then, by
about a few of ten.

Mor2019 did isochrone fitting to Gaia, and found the same, but with a
spike at 3Gyr.

Our inferred gyro-age distribution of the Kepler field seems to agree
with these pictures.  The main value added is likely over the first
gigayear.

\subsection{Isochrone Age Comparison}

\subsection{Lithium Age Comparison}

\subsection{Gyrochronal Age Comparison}
Searching the literature for gyrochronal analyses of the Kepler field,
the most relevant studies seemed to be those of
\citet{Walkowicz_2013}, \citet{Reinhold_2015}, and 
\citet{David_2021}.

Also Mathur2023, which does ``magneto-gyrochronology'', including the

Our rotation analysis blindly recovered the 14 known Kepler planets in
clusters (Section~\ref{subsec:clusterplanets}), and provided accurate
independent ages for their host stars.

While lithium provides only marginal added information for most of
this sample, we report new robust ages from both rotation and
lithium for 14 confirmed $<$500\,Myr planets, including five
mini-Neptunes, five super-Earths, three Earths and sub-Earths, and a
Neptune-sized planet.

		For a star to have a high likelihood of being ``reliable for gyrochronology'' we suggest $Q_{\rm star}$ bits

\section{Cases With Inconsistent Rotation and Lithium-Based Ages}
\label{app:inconsistent}

For Kepler-957, $T_{\rm eff}$=4947\,K, and $P_{\rm rot}$=4.52\,days,
This implies a rotation-based age of $96_{-72}^{+192}$\,Myr.  The
rotational broadening of the spectrum ($v\sin
i$$\approx$9.8$\pm$1.0\kms) is consistent with the nominal stellar
rotation period.  However, if this star were $\lesssim$500\,Myr old,
lithium should have been detectable at $>$50\,m\AA.  Lithium is
marginally if at all present in the spectrum ({\bf  EW$_{\rm
Li}$$<$XX\,m\AA at 2$\sigma$ }).  While the planet (nominally
6.9\,$R_\oplus$ on a 5.9\,day orbit) has been statistically validated
\citep{Morton_2016}, inspecting the data validation reports this is
somewhat surprising.  The light curve shows greater scatter in-transit
than out of transit, appears near-grazing, and has a suggestion of a
strong odd-even depth difference.  This is a surprising system that
merits further attention.

% from inconsitent_tli_tgyro cases:
Kepler-1644 b

these have finite Li ages, but no rotation age (perhaps b/c of the missing prots...)
