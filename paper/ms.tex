\begin{abstract}
  Recent studies of stars in open clusters have yielded a detailed picture
  of how the rotation rates and lithium content of FGK stars evolve
  during the main sequence.
  %
  Here we apply this knowledge to planets and stars observed by the
  primary Kepler mission, and report the resulting rotation and
  lithium-based ages.
  %
  Rotation periods are collected from previous analyses of
  Kepler data; lithium is measured from new and archival HIRES
  spectra.
  %
  We report rotation-based ages for \nuniqstarsantosrotgyroappl\ stars
  and \nplwgyroagenograzing\ planets for which we believe
  gyrochronology is likely valid. %, and for many more for which the underlying assumptions of
%  the technique may be compromised.
  %
  The relative statistical precisions from rotation, $\sigma_{t_{\rm
  gyro}} / t_{\rm gyro}$, are XX +YY -ZZ\%, which is X.X +Y.Y -Z.Z more
  statistically precise than isochronal ages for the same stars, and
  $\approx$X.X times less precise than cluster-based ages.
  %
  The results include \nplyounggyrotwosigma\
  planets younger than 1\,Gyr at 2$\sigma$ (\nplyounggyrothreesigma\
  planets at 3$\sigma$).
  %
  While lithium provides only marginal added information for most of
  this sample,
  we report robust two-sided age measurements from both rotation and
  lithium for 14 confirmed $<$500\,Myr planets, including five
  mini-Neptunes, five super-Earths, three Earths and sub-Earths, and a
  Neptune-sized planet.
  %
  In the broader Kepler target star sample,
  we find
  that the gyrochrone age distribution rises linearly from 0 to
  3\,Gyr, with stars 2\,Gyr old being twice as common in the Kepler
  field as stars 1\,Gyr old.
  %
  This approach offers greater sensitivity to main sequence ages than
  previous analyses of the Milky Way's star formation history, and the
  resulting age distribution bounds the relative balance of ``young''
  and ``old'' planets detectable not only by Kepler, but also by
  future wide-field transit surveys.
  %
%  The sample of detected Kepler planets has a similar age
%  distribution, though it is slightly deficient at $\lesssim$0.2\,Gyr,
%  likely due to decreased detection sensitivity.
  %
  %Combining our stellar age catalog with Kepler's completeness products, we perform
  %a hierarchical bayesian analysis to infer the average number of planets per star
  %as a function of both stellar and planetary parameters.
  %
  %While we recover many previously known correlations with stellar mass and metallicity,
  %our analysis also highlights the importance of age in shaping the ``sub-Saturn desert'',
  %and in influencing the evolution of the mini-Neptune and super-Earth populations.
  %TODO will this be the case?
%  We also comment on a few previously reported evolutionary trends in
%  the size evolution of close-in mini-Neptunes (2-4\,\rearth) and
%  super-Earths (1-2\,\rearth), a few of which we recover at comparable
%  ($\sim$3$\sigma$) significance to previous work, and one of which we
%  note for the first time.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Discovering a young planet requires solving two problems: find the
planet, and measure the star's age.  Each problem can be solved in
various ways, and so there are many paths for discovery.  In this
manuscript, we will focus on planets discovered using transits, and
stellar ages measured based using empirical rotation and lithium-based
methods.  Rotation-based age-dating will provide the most information
for the largest number of stars.  The lithium-based technique will
provide useful information for the subset of stars younger than a few
hundred million years.

To help build intuition, it is useful to assume that the age
distribution of stars within the nearest few hundred parsecs of the
Sun (i.e.~in the Solar Neighborhood) is uniform between 0 and 10\,Gyr
\citep{Nordstrom_2004}.  We will revisit this assumption later in the
manuscript.  While the youngest 0.1\% of stars ($\lesssim$10\,million
years; Myr) are perhaps the most constraining for studies of planet
formation, they are extremely challenging targets for close-in
exoplanet detection 
\citep[see e.g.][]{Damasso_2020,Bouma_2020_ptfo,Donati_2020}.  Studies of
the early orbital, structural, and atmospheric evolution of exoplanets
are perhaps most technically feasible for the $\approx$1\% of stars
with ages between 10 and 100\,Myr, or perhaps even the 10\% of stars
younger than 1\,Gyr.  However, since stellar ages are roughly
uniformly distributed in the solar neighborhood, there is a limit on
the sample size of young planets that will be detectable in these age
regimes, particularly relative to their older breathren.

%TODO mention the RV approach?  at least the Hyades etc work...
A wide range of approaches have, over the past ten years, begun to
establish the subfield of young, close-in planet discovery.
Pioneering discoveries with the prime Kepler mission (hereafter,
``Kepler'') focused on stars with known ages---stars in clusters---and
searched them for transiting planets \citep{Meibom_2013}.  Planets
discovered in this way are assumed to have the same age as the host
cluster.  The
resulting ages are precise at the $\approx$10\% level.  K2
and TESS have yielded larger numbers of young planets in clusters than
Kepler, because each of these missions has observed a larger fraction
of the sky, and therefore more stars with known ages
\citep[e.g.][]{Mann_K2_25_2016,Mann_2017,Curtis_2018,Livingston_2018,David_2019,Bouma_2020_toi837,Rizzuto_2020,Plavchan_2020,Newton_2021,Nardiello_2022,Tofflemire_2021,Zhou_2022,Zakhozhay_2022,Wood_2023}.

A limitation of the ``cluster-first'' approach is that only
$\approx$1\% of stars within the nearest few hundred parsecs can
currently be associated with their birth cluster
\citep[e.g.][]{Zari_2018,CantatGaudin_2020,Kounkel_2020,Kerr_2021}.
This means that there are many ``young'' (0.05-1\,Gyr) stars in the
field that are omitted by cluster-only searches.
Of order 40 transiting planets are currently known to be younger than
1\,Gyr, requiring an age precision $t/\sigma_t > 3$.
%TODO cite???
% (see
%Figure~\ref{fig:rp_period_age}).
However, Kepler discovered
$\approx$4{,}000 planets; and so unless there is a major discovery
bias, we would expect a larger fraction of the Kepler
planets---perhaps 10\%, or 400 planets---to be younger than 1\,Gyr.

Have these young Kepler planets already been found?  If they have, the
most likely studies to have found them would be those by
\citet{Berger_2020b_rpage}, \citet{David_2021} or
\citet{Petigura_2022}.  The \citeauthor{Berger_2020b_rpage} and
\citeauthor{Petigura_2022} studies focused on
isochronal age-dating of individual stars, which is most precise 
for stars whose luminosities and temperature separate them from the
main-sequence.  The \citeauthor{David_2021} study leveraged both isochronal
ages from an earlier analogous study
\citep{Fulton_Petigura_2018_cks_vii}, and, in their core analysis, a
relative gyrochrone age-ranking approach that sorted stars based on
whether they rotated faster or slower than a gyrochrone age of
$\approx$2.6\,Gyr \citep{Meibom_2015,Curtis_2020}.

Theoretical predictions for planet evolution in the Kepler sample are
most important in the context of mini-Neptunes and super-Earths, since
these are the most abundant planets.  Pertinent predictions include:
{\it a)} that mini-Neptunes should cool and contract, roughly
following a $R_p \propto t^{-0.1}$ scaling \citep{Gupta_2019}; {\it
b)} that large and close-in mini-Neptunes at the edge of the
photoevaporation desert should shrink over the atmospheric loss
timescale, $t_{\rm loss}$ \citep{Owen_Lai_2018}; {\it c)} that the
abundance of 4-8\,R$_\oplus$ planets with masses of 5-30\,M$_\oplus$
should decrease over $t_{\rm loss}$---the upper-envelope of the
mini-Neptune size distribution should corresponding decrease,
e.g.~from $\approx$4.5\,R$_\oplus$ at $\approx$200\,Myr to
$\approx$3.5\,R$_\oplus$ at $\approx$700\,Myr
\citep[e.g.][]{Rogers_2021}; {\it d)} that the super-Earth to
mini-Neptune ratio, $\theta$, should increase over $t_{\rm loss}$
\citep[e.g.][]{Rogers_2021}, with the mini-Neptune abundance
decreasing by at least a factor of two or three, and the super-Earth
abundance increasing in tandem; {\it e)} that the
upper boundary of the super-Earth population should increase over the
same timescale as $\theta$ is increasing, since more massive
super-Earth cores should be able to retain their envelopes for longer
than less massive cores.

The details of the predictions are flexible, in that they depend on
the distributions of planetary core masses, initial atmospheric mass
fractions, and initial entropies of the atmospheres after disk
dispersal.  For instance, different sources of heating---from the star
\citep{Owen_Wu_2013,Lopez_Fortney_2014,Jin_2014}, planetary interior
\citep{Gupta_2019}, or even giant impacts
\citep{Biersteker_Schlichting_2019}---can produce very different
histories for the size evolution of planets at these early times
\citep[e.g.][]{Owen_2020}.  Different internal compositions also alter
the predicted size evolution \citep[e.g.][]{2024NatAs.tmp...33B}.  The
generic prediction that the ``upper envelope'' of the mini-Neptune
size distribution should shrink due to Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling is
hard to avoid; predictions however concerning the ``radius valley''
and movement of planets across it are dependent on the timescales and
prevalence of atmospheric mass loss.  In specific scenarios for
initial atmospheric accretion \citep{Lee_2022} and early atmospheric
evolution \citep{2024MNRAS.529.2716R} the radius gap might form
without needing to invoke post-disk dispersal mass loss at all.  In
such scenarios, there could be very little evolution of the planetary
size distribution between 1 and 4\,\rearth\ over the first gigayear.

Can stellar age measurements provide evidence for or against
these different models?  Neither {\it (a)} nor {\it (b)} has yet had a
convincing---or even suggestive--- detection reported (see
\citealt{Petigura_2022}).  While an apparent over-abundance of large
very young planets ({\it (c)}) has been noted by multiple authors
\citep[e.g.][]{2017AJ....153...64M,Bouma_2020}, its presence is almost certainly
exacerbated by a selection effect against sub-Neptune sized planet
detection at $<$100\,Myr \citep{Zhou_2021,Bouma_2022b}.  Recent studies have
nonetheless found that when accounting for completeness, there is
$\approx$3$\sigma$ evidence that hot mini-Neptunes are more prevalent in
$\approx$100-500\,Myr old K2 \citep{2023AJ....166..248C} and TESS
\citep{2024arXiv240303261V} stars than in the older Kepler sample
\citep[e.g.][]{2020AJ....159..248K}.
%TODO: more kepler citations...

Regarding the observed mini-Neptune to super-Earth ratio, {\it (d)} and {\it
(e)} were explored by \citet{Berger_2020b_rpage} and the twin
\citet{David_2021} and \citet{Sandoval_2021} studies.  Both
\citet{Berger_2020b_rpage} and \citet{Sandoval_2021} reported that $\theta$
increases with time, at a statistical significance of $\approx$2-3$\sigma$.
For \citet{Berger_2020b_rpage}, this conclusion was reached by comparing the
sizes of 85 planets with median isochronal ages younger than 1\,Gyr with a
property-matched sample of planets older than 1\,Gyr.  In
\citet{Sandoval_2021}, the conclusion was reached by computing the ratio while
performing a Monte Carlo re-sampling procedure from the isochronal ages and
planetary sizes computed by \citet{Fulton_Petigura_2018_cks_vii}.  Finally,
effect {\it (e)} was reported by \citet{David_2021}, who found that the average
location of the radius valley shifted from $\approx$1.8\,R$_\oplus$ to
$\approx$2.0\,R$_\oplus$ between 1.8 and 3.2\,Gyr.

The fact that stellar ages---and especially isochronal ages---are
correlated with stellar masses and metallicities is a source of stress
for many in this subfield.  \citet{Sandoval_2021} for instance noted a
strong trend in $\theta$ as a function of stellar metallicity in
addition to the trend they noted in age, and cautioned that this could
also explain their observations.  Independently, \citet{Petigura_2018}
and \citet{Petigura_2022} have reported trends between small-planet
occurrence and both stellar metallicity and mass; these parameters
seem, at first glance, to be more important predictors of bulk changes
in the planetary population than age.  Given these known correlations,
it can be useful to consider population models in which variables such
as metallicity, mass, and age are added in succession
\citep[e.g.][]{Thorngren_2021}.  An alternative, and perhaps more
rigorous approach, is to jointly infer the number of planets per star
as a function of both planetary and stellar parameters, the latter
including age \citep[e.g.][]{2023AJ....166..209M}.  Such analyses are
most effective when the measurement precision of these different
parameters is as high as possible.

Gyrochronology offers ages precise to $\lesssim$30\% for FGK stars
between 0.5-4\,Gyr, and can also provide useful age limits at
earlier times \citep{Bouma_2023}.  The idea of using a star's
spin-down as a clock is quite old
\citep{Skumanich_1972,Noyes_1984,Kawaler_1989,Barnes03,Mamajek_2008,Angus_2015},
and physics-based models for the spin-down itself can clarify many
aspects of how the stellar winds, internal structure, and magnetic
dynamo all evolve
\citep[e.g.][]{Matt_2015,Gallet_Bouvier_2015,Spada_2020}.  Key
for our analysis is the fact that we can empirically calibrate
rotation-based ages using measured sequences of rotation periods
in open clusters
(\citealt{Bouma_2023}, and references therein).  This approach
ultimately ties the rotation age scale to the cluster age scale, and
is limited in precision by the intrisic scatter in the $P_{\rm rot}$
sequences, and in accuracy by systematic uncertainties in the evolving
spin-down rates, and in the cluster ages themselves.
The oldest cluster for which this method has been calibrated is currently
M67 \citep[$\approx$4\,Gyr][]{2022ApJ...938..118D}.

Lithium-based age-dating includes two qualitatively distinct regimes:
depletion boundary ages derived for M-dwarfs in star clusters, and the
less precise decline-based ages for individual field FGK stars
\citep{Soderblom_2010}.  Here we focus on the latter approach, which
relies on the observation that the Li abundances of
partially-convective stars gradually decline as they age
\citep[e.g.][]{2005A&A...442..615S}.  The theoretical explanation for
this decline is debated
\citep[e.g.][]{1995ApJ...441..865C,2010ApJ...716.1269D,2019MNRAS.485.4052C}
Empirical understanding has however recently improved due to the work
by \citet{Jeffries_2023}, who built a model for how the equivalent
width (EW) of the \ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet evolves as a function
of stellar effective temperature and age for a set of 6{,}200 stars in
52 open clusters.  Two-sided lithium ages are useful for Kepler (FGK)
stars between $\approx$0.03-0.5\,Gyr, with a strong dependence on
spectral type since the K-dwarfs lose their surface lithium much
faster than G-dwarfs.  The precision of the ages reported by the
\citet{Jeffries_2023} method in this regime are in the range of
0.3-0.5~dex.

The methods by which we select the stellar and planet samples are 
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:selection}.
We summarize the origin of stellar parameters other than the ages in
Section~\ref{sec:stellarprops}, 
and describe and validate our age-dating methods in
Sections~\ref{sec:rotage} and~\ref{sec:liage}.
The population-level trends for both the parent stellar sample and
the planet sample are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
A few conclusions are offered in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Sample Selection}
\label{sec:selection}

This work focuses on stars surveyed by Kepler for which ages can be
inferred using either stellar rotation, lithium, or both.  These
``age-dateable stars'' are a relatively small subset of the
\nkeplerstars\ Kepler targets.  Rotation periods provide the majority
of the information, since they have been reported for
$\approx$55{,}000 Kepler stars
\citep[e.g.][]{McQuillan_2014,Santos_2021}.  
High-resolution measurements of the \ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet are
available for only a few thousand Kepler objects of interest (KOIs).
We therefore define our selection function as Kepler stars
with measured rotation periods ($\mathcal{S}$;
Section~\ref{subsec:starsel}), and Kepler planets whose host stars
have measured rotation periods ($\mathcal{P}$;
Section~\ref{subsec:planetsel}).


\subsection{Rotation periods}
\label{subsec:starsel}

We select stars with rotation periods that have been measured by
previous investigators.  Studies of stellar rotation across the entire
Kepler field include those by \citet{McQuillan_2014}
(\citetalias{McQuillan_2014}), \citet{Reinhold_2015},
\citet{Santos_2019} (\citetalias{Santos_2019}), and
\citet{Santos_2021} (\citetalias{Santos_2021}).
\citetalias{McQuillan_2014} used an approach based on the
autocorrelation function to detect 34{,}030 rotation periods for
main-sequence Kepler targets cooler than 6500\,K, and excluded known
eclipsing binaries and KOIs.  \citet{Reinhold_2015} used an iterative
Lomb-Scargle based approach to analyze $\approx$40{,}000 stars with a
variability range $R_{\rm var}>0.3$\% that were not known EBs, planet
candidates, or pulsators; they reported primary rotation periods for
24{,}124 of these stars.  \citet{Reinhold_2015} also reported
secondary periods for two thirds of the stars with primary periods,
which could be caused by differential rotation or finite spot
lifetimes.  Finally, \citetalias{Santos_2019} and
\citetalias{Santos_2021} combined a wavelet analysis and
autocorrelation-based approach, and cumulatively reported rotation
periods for 55{,}232 main-sequence and subgiant FGKM stars.
\citetalias{Santos_2019} and \citetalias{Santos_2021} included known
KOIs and binaries, and assigned them specific quality flags.  The
rotation periods of KOIs have received considerable additional
scrutiny
\citep[e.g.][]{Walkowicz_2013,Mazeh_2015,Angus_2018,David_2021}.

We choose to adopt the results of \citetalias{Santos_2019} and
\citetalias{Santos_2021} as our default rotation periods.
\citetalias{Santos_2021} provides a detailed comparison against
\citetalias{McQuillan_2014}; the brief summary is that the periods
agree for 99.0\% of the 31{,}038 period detections in common between
the two studies.  \citetalias{Santos_2021} classified the 2{,}992
remaining stars from \citetalias{McQuillan_2014} as not showing
rotation periods based on updated knowledge of contaminants
(e.g.~giant stars and eclipsing binaries) and visual inspection.
In addition,
\citetalias{Santos_2021} report rotation periods for 24{,}182
main-sequence and subgiant FGKM stars that were not reported as
periodic by \citetalias{McQuillan_2014}.  Many of
these reported detections have lower variability amplitudes, and
longer periods, than those reported by
\citetalias{McQuillan_2014}.  A relevant flag for stars
missing \citetalias{McQuillan_2014} periods is included in
Table~\ref{tab:stars} {\bf TODO make this}.  Reviewing the resulting period detections, we
learned that 32 KOIs with orbital and rotation periods within
$\approx$20\% were excluded from the \citetalias{Santos_2019} and
\citetalias{Santos_2021} catalogs (A.~Santos, priv.~comm.) ; we choose
to include these objects.\footnote{In general, excluding stars in this
category would impose a bias against young close-in planets, due to
the natural commensurability between the rotation rates of young
stars, and Kepler's increased sensitivity to short-period objects.
While some of these KOIs are known false positives, our analysis
naturally excludes such objects at later steps.  As one motivating
example, this subset of stars happens to include {\it
e.g.}~Kepler~1643 (KIC~8653134), with $P_{\rm orb}$=5.34\,days and
$P_{\rm rot}$=5.05\,days, which is known to be $\approx$40\,Myr old
based on membership in RSG-5 \citep{Bouma_2022b}.  }
The final tally of stars from \citetalias{Santos_2019},
\citetalias{Santos_2021}, and our corrected KOI list is
\nuniqstarsantosrot\ Kepler stars with rotation periods.

%  %TODO is it?
%  We verified that the main conclusions of our analysis do not change if
%  we were to adopt only the periods from \citetalias{McQuillan_2014}.
%  %TODO have you?




\subsection{Kepler objects of interest}
\label{subsec:planetsel}

We considered two different samples of planets: those in the fully
automated Q1-Q17 DR25 KOI Table \citep{Thompson_2018}, which is
suitable for planet occurrence rate calculations, and also those in
the cumulative KOI table, which included the best knowledge available
on any given planet candidate as of 2023 Jun 6, but incorporated
human-based vetting \footnote{See
\url{https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/PurposeOfKOITable.html}}.
For the main body of this work, we will refer to the former
homogeneous sample, which includes \nkois\ KOIs, \nkoisnofp\ that are
not known false positives; Appendix~\ref{app:cumulativekoi} highlights
some additional young planets that are omitted in this approach.

Crossmatching the Q1-Q17 DR25 KOI table against our stars with
rotation periods yields \nkoiswithprot\ KOIs with rotation periods, of
which \nkoisnofpwithprot\ are not known false postives.  These objects
will comprise the core data for our gyrochronology analysis.

As a sanity check on the statistical uncertainties of these rotation
periods, we compared our adopted \citetalias{Santos_2019} and
\citetalias{Santos_2021} periods with those reported by
\citet{McQuillan_2014} and \citet{Mazeh_2015}.  We found that for
$P_{\rm rot}\lesssim$15\,days, the two datasets agree at a precision
of $\lesssim$0.01$P_{\rm rot}$.  At longer periods of $P_{\rm
rot}\approx$30\,days, the agreement was typically at the
$\lesssim$0.03$P_{\rm rot}$ level, and the upper envelope of the
period difference tended to increase linearly with period.  Based on
this comparison, we adopted a simple prescription for the period
uncertainties, such that there are 1\% relative uncertainties below
$P_{\rm rot}=15$\,days, and a linear increase thereafter, with slope
set to guarantee 3\% $P_{\rm rot}$ uncertainties at 30 days.



\subsection{Lithium sample}
A final subcomponent of our analysis involves an age assessment based on
the equivalent width of the \ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet.  For this
component of the work, we primarily rely on spectra acquired with the
High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES;
\citealt{vogt_hires_1994}) on the Keck I 10m telescope.
Most of these spectra were acquired between 2010 and 2020
as part of the California Keck Survey (CKS).
A subset were acquired by our team in our own observing programs.
%TODO quantify.
%TODO compare to berger2018?

These HIRES spectra are available for \nkoiswithhires\ of the
\nkoisnofp\ non-false-positive KOIs.
In the broader stellar sample, they are available for a much smaller 
fraction of the stars observed by Kepler, because they were generally only
acquired due to the presence of a transiting planet candidate.
Given this selection function,
we leverage these spectra in our analysis as a way to scrutinize the
ages of just the planet sample.

As our default source for stellar temperatures and surface gravities,
we adopt the values from the Gaia-Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog
(GKSP; \citealt{Berger_2020a_catalog}).  The GKSP parameters are
available for stars with ``AAA'' 2MASS photometry, measured parallaxes
in Gaia DR2,  and $g$-band photometry from either the KIC or the
Kepler-INT survey.  The parameters themselves were derived using
\texttt{isoclassify} \citep{2017ApJ...844..102H} to interpolate over
the MIST isochrone grids
\citep{2016ApJ...823..102C,2016ApJS..222....8D}, given the SDSS $g$
and 2MASS $K_{\rm s}$ photometry, the Gaia DR2 parallaxes, and
$V$-band extinction from the \citet{2018MNRAS.478..651G} reddening
map.  The resulting stellar parameters are available for
\fracstarswithprotwithbtwenty\ of the \nuniqstarsantosrot\ Kepler
stars with rotation periods.
\citet{David_2021} compared the stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$,
$R_\star$, [Fe/H]) derived from the \citet{Berger_2020a_catalog}
isochronal approach with the spectroscopic parameters from
\citet{Fulton_2018}.  While this approach is one way of validating the
\citet{Berger_2020a_catalog} output, the temperature scales did show a
few-percent difference, with \citetalias{Fulton_2018} quoting higher
temperatures than \citetalias{Berger_2020a_catalog} for mid K dwarfs,
and lower temperatures for early F dwarfs.


%For the remaining \fracstarswithprotwithoutbtwenty\ of stars that lack
%temperatures and surface gravities, we adopt the values 
%from the Gaia DR3 General Stellar Parametrizer from Photometry (GSP-Phot; CITE).
%GSP-Phot uses the low-resolution Gaia BP and RP spectra, mean $G$ magnitudes,
%and parallaxes, in concert with the PARSEC isochrones (CITE Tang2014, Chen2015,
%Pastorelli2020) to infer the stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities,
%metallicities, and line-of-sight extinctions.

For the remaining \fracstarswithprotwithoutbtwenty\ of stars that lack
temperatures and surface gravities from
\citetalias{Berger_2020a_catalog}, we adopt the values reported by
\citet{Santos_2019} and \citet{Santos_2021}, which for these cases
primarily derive from the \citet{Mathur_2017} DR25 Kepler Stellar
Properties Catalog, and are mostly derived from photometry.  In the
planet sample, \frackoisnofpwithprotwithbtwenty\ of the
non-false-positive KOIs with rotation periods have parameters from
\citet{Berger_2020a_catalog}, and the remainder similarly are drawn
from DR25.

\section{Ages From Rotation}
\label{sec:rotage}



We calculate gyrochrone ages using \texttt{gyro-interp}
\citep{Bouma_2023}.  We built this statistical framework to address
the issue that, especially over the first gigayear of stellar
spin-down, stars with the same mass and same rotation period can have
very different ages \citep[e.g.][]{Curtis_2019_ngc6811}.  The
gyrochrone age posterior should therefore incorporate this intrinsic
population-level scatter into the precision with which the age can be
measured.  The three main assumptions behind the \texttt{gyro-interp}
framework are as follows.  {\it 1)} The stars are on the main
sequence, {\it 2)} their spindown is not influenced by binary
companions, and {\it 3)} the rotation period distribution for field
stars of a given mass and age is identical to that of the calibration
open clusters (metallicity differences, for instance, are ignored).  
Regarding the former two assumptions: pre-main-sequence and
post-main-sequence evolution introduce variations in the stellar
angular momentum budget.  Similarly, tidal effects might
systematically spin up (or down) stars in binaries.

Using our adopted effective temperatures and rotation periods, we ran
\texttt{gyro-interp} over an age grid of 0 to 4\,Gyr, linearly spaced
over 500 grid points.  \texttt{gyro-interp} itself is only calibrated
out to 4\,Gyr, the adopted age of the M67 cluster
\citep[see][]{Dungee_2022,Gruner_2023}.  To estimate the stellar
spin-down rate as a function of time and stellar temperature, this
framework interpolates between reference open clusters using smooth
cubic hermite polynomials.  We calculate the probability of the
rotation-based age $t_{\rm gyro}$, given the observed rotation
periods, effective temperatures, and their uncertainties by
integrating Equation~1 of \citep{Bouma_2023} at the default grid
resolution.  This procedure marginalizes over the intrinsic age and
temperature dependent scatter that is observed in the cluster
sequences to yield statistical age uncertainties.

\subsection{Gyrochronology Quality Flags}
\label{subsec:flags}
We calculated gyrochrone age posteriors for all \nuniqstarsantosrot\
stars with reported rotation periods and effective temperatures.  To
select stars for which we expect these age to in fact be valid, we
then build a set of quality flags.  When and how these flags should be
applied depends on the question being asked.  If the goal is to
construct a false-positive free sample, they might all be applied.  If
the goal is constructing a complete sample of young stars, then
consider the examples of Kepler~1627Ab ($\approx$40\,Myr) and
Kepler~51c ($\approx$625\,Myr).  The former has a high RUWE due to a
resolved binary companion \citep{Bouma_2022a}; the latter is on a
grazing orbit \citep{2014ApJ...783...53M}.  The flags in
Tables~\ref{tab:stars} and~\ref{tab:planets} enable selecting for or
against such cases using bit flags.

{\it Temperature range (bit 0)}---We require stars to have effective
temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$ between 3800 and 6200\,K in order to report
gyrochrone ages \citep{Bouma_2023}.   Stars hotter than 6200\,K spin
down very slowly, if at all.  Stars cooler than 3800\,K do spin down
over gigayear timescales (e.g. {\bf CITE} E.Newton thesis, the Engle
paper, and Chiti's article), but the currently available open cluster
data have yet to clarify at what times, if any, the intrinsic scatter
in the population decreases.

{\it Surface gravity (bit 1)}---We flagged stars as possible subgiants
if they had $\log g < 4.2$.  We set this threshold by examining the
relevant flag from \citet{berger_2018_radii_evolnstates},
cross-matched against \citet{Berger_2020a_catalog}.
%\citet{berger_2018_radii_evolnstates} performed this classification
%using the PARSEC evolutionary models, stellar radii, and DR25 stellar
%properties catalog effective temperatures \citep{Mathur_2017}.

{\it Absolute luminosity (bit 2)}---We calculated the absolute Gaia
DR3 $G$-band luminosity, ignoring reddening, using the reported
apparent $G$-band magnitude and parallaxes.  We flag stars with
$M_{\rm G} < 3.9$, corresponding to main-sequence spectral types
earlier than $\approx$F8V \citep{Pecaut_2013}.

{\it Known eclipsing binaries (bit 3)}---We flagged any stars reported
to be in the final Kepler eclipsing binary catalog (KEBC;
\citealt{2016AJ....151...68K}).

{\it Kepler-Gaia crossmatch quality (bits 4 and 5)}--- In situations
where we wanted to leverage Gaia DR3 data, we used M.~Bedell's 4$''$
Kepler-to-Gaia crossmatch\footnote{\url{https://gaia-kepler.fun}, last
accessed 15 April 2024.  We used 4$''$ rather than the 1$''$ match
because 91 KOIs are omitted in the 1$''$ match, 23 of which have
either ``candidate'' or ``confirmed'' status.  Almost all of these 23
are M dwarfs with high proper motions.  Performing the same crossmatch
at 4 arcseconds, only two KOIs (KOI-3993 and KOI-6531), both known
false positives, fail to yield Gaia DR3 crossmatches.}, which is a
crossmatch of the NASA Exoplanet Archive
\texttt{q1\_q17\_dr25\_stellar} catalog with Gaia DR3.  The separation
distribution of the Kepler-Gaia DR3 crossmatches is such that 99.2\%
of candidate matches are within 1$''$.   We nonetheless noted an
upturn in the candidate match rate from 3-4$''$; such sources are
flagged using bit 4.  For KIC stars with multiple potential Gaia
matches within the 4$''$ search radius, we adopted the brightest star
as the default match.  In most such cases this was unambiguous because
there is a large brightness difference between the primary and any
apparent neighbors.  However cases with multiple stars within 4$''$
within $\Delta G$$<$$0.5$\,mag are noted using bit flag 5.  

{\it Gaia DR3 non-single-stars (bit 6)}---The Gaia DR3
\texttt{non\_single\_star} column in the \texttt{gaia\_source} table
flags known eclipsing, astrometric, and spectroscopic binaries.  We
directly include this column.

{\it RUWE (bit 7)}---We flagged stars with a Gaia DR3 renormalized
unit weight error
(RUWE\footnote{\url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR3/Gaia_archive/chap_datamodel/sec_dm_main_source_catalogue/ssec_dm_gaia_source.html}})
exceeding 1.4 as possible binaries.  Such astrometric outliers can be
either bona fide astrometric binaries, or more often are marginally
resolved point sources for which the single-source PSF model used in
the Gaia pipeline induces spurious astrometric scatter.

{\it Crowding (bit 8)}---We searched the Gaia DR3 point source catalog
for stars within 1 Kepler pixel (4$''$) of every target star.  While
many such companions are not physically associated with the target
star, their presence can bias stellar parameters and stellar rotation
period measurements.  We therefore flag any stars with neighbors down
to 10$\times$ the brightness of the target star within this region
($\Delta G < 2.5$).

{\it Near the main-sequence (bit 9)}---Many stars observed by Kepler
are far from the main sequence: this can be seen in color--absolute
magnitude diagrams, and in diagrams of e.g.~surface gravity as a
function of temperature (Figure~\ref{fig:stellarprops}).  This is a
challenge for rotation-based age-dating because {\it i)} point sources
far from the main-sequence include unresolved photometric binaries,
and {\it ii}) effects other than magnetic braking influence the
rotation periods of bona fide single stars far from the main-sequence.
The added complications of reddening and metallicity make defining a
simple cut in any two dimensions challenging.  We explored various
options, and found that the $+1$$\sigma$ relative isochronal
uncertainty reported by \citet{Berger_2020a_catalog}, $+\sigma_{t,{\rm
B20,iso}}/t_{\rm B20,iso}$, reasonably separated FGK stars ``near'' and
``far'' from the main-sequence.  We therefore selected stars with
$t_{\rm B20,iso}/(+\sigma_{t,{\rm B20,iso}})\approx 3$, and fitted an
an $N^{\rm th}$-order polynomial in the $\log g$-$T_{\rm eff}$ plane
to these stars between 4100 and 5800\,K.  We let the order of the fit
vary from $N$=1 to 10, and minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion
yielded $N$=6.  The resulting locus is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:stellarprops}.  While the details of this procedure
are entirely arbitrary, the overall purpose is to exclude stars for
which there is photometric evidence that gyrochronology may not be
reliable.  The rotation period distribution of sources excluded in
this manner includes a larger fraction of ``rapid rotators'', likely
due to a combination of astrophysical and systematic effects.



{\it Candidate pulsators and close-in binaries (bit
10)}---\citeauthor{Santos_2021} included in a flag for candidate
``classical pulsators'' (e.g. RR~Lyrae, Cepheids) and candidate
close-in binaries.  Visual inspection hints that this flag also
includes many bona fide young stars, and so although we propagate it 
to our set of quality flags, we generally ignore it.

An important decision for our subsequent analysis is how to combine
the above flags in order to decide whether or not a star is suited for
gyrochronology.  By default, we assume that a star is suitable for
gyrochronology if none of bits zero through nine are raised.


\subsection{Planet Quality Flags}
\label{subsec:plflags}
For the subset of our analysis that focuses on the properties of
planets, we use the following additional quality flags.

% see Erik's 2022 discussion; might want to shift to include a cut on
% disposition score.
{\it Candidate reliability}---no false positives; only ``planet
candidates'' and ``confirmed planets''.

{\it Candidate S/N}---the false positive rate increases greatly toward
Kepler's noise floor for planet detection (CITE).  We required a S/N
in excess of the usual floor, through a cut on the ``multiple event
statistic'' (MES): we required ${\rm MES}$$>$10.

{\it Grazing planets}---grazing objects ($b$>0.8) often provide
non-robust planetary sizes due to the size-impact parameter
degeneracy.  Particularly for large planets, they can also include
astrophysical false positives at higher rates (due to the same
degeneracy).  While we include a flag for such objects, we by default
do not exclude them from our analysis; this is because...{\bf justify}.

    The periods are from \citet{Santos_2019} and \citet{Santos_2021}

    only apparently single stars near the main sequence with $\log

    flagged as eclipsing binaries.  The planet sample has the same
    stellar cuts, and shows confirmed and candidate planets from the
    cumulative KOI table, requiring them to have a MES$>$10.

	\label{fig:prot_vs_teff}
\end{figure}

The rotation periods for the stellar and planetary samples are shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:prot_vs_teff}.  Out of the \nkeplerstars\ stars
observed by Kepler, requiring reported rotation periods and a
reliable DR3 crossmatch yielded
\nuniqstarsantosrot\ stars.  Further requiring these rotating stars
to have temperatures 3800$<$$T_{\rm eff}$/K$<$6200, which is the range
over which \texttt{gyro-interp} returns finite age posteriors,
yields \nuniqstarsantosrotteffcut\ stars.
Further requiring them to be apparently single, near the main
sequence, with $\log g$$>$4.2, $M_{\rm G}>3.9$, and not flagged as
eclipsing binaries yielded \nuniqstarsantosallbutruwe\ rotators
potentially amenable for gyrochronology.
Finally, imposing RUWE$<$1.4 and requiring no possible blends ($\Delta
G$<2.5) within 4$''$ leaves \nuniqstarsantosrotgyroappl\ stars for
which gyrochronology is likely to be valid.


In the planet sample, the cumulative KOI table included
\nnonfpcumkois\ confirmed and candidate planets, orbiting
\nnonfpcumkoihosts\ stars.  Assume that we apply all the same stellar
cuts, save for that on RUWE.
Then,
require these confirmed and candidate planets to have MES$>$10.
This combination of selection criteria
yield \nplwgyroagewithgrazingandhighruwe\ planets with rotation-based
ages orbiting \nplhoststarwgyroagewithgrazingandhighruwe\ stars
(\nplhoststarwgyroagejusthighruwe\ of these stars with ``high'' RUWE).
If we additionally require the planets to be non-grazing ($b<0.8$)
based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits from
\citet{Thompson_2018}, we are left with \nplwgyroagenograzing\ and
\nplhoststarwgyroagenograzing\ planets and stars, respectively.

\end{figure}

%TODO: does JUMP mirror all HIRES data from KOA?
We queried the internal CPS archive to collect all HIRES spectra that
were available for the \nplhoststarwgyroagewithgrazingandhighruwe\
stars for which rotation-based ages can be derived.
This exercise yielded at least one spectrum for \nlithiumstars\ and 
\nlithiumplanets\ planets.
We did not constrain whether the iodine cell was used, since
there are no relevant lines in the region of the 
\ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet.
These observations were acquired between 6 September 2009 and 16
May 2024, primarily by the California Kepler Survey (CKS,
CITE).
In preparation for this study, we additionally collected {\bf XX}
spectra for ``confirmed'' planets with rotation-based ages below
1\,Gyr.

To measure the lithium equivalent widths, we followed the procedure
described by \citet{Bouma_2021}.
The stars of interest for this work are FGK stars, and so the
continuum in the vicinity of the
\ion{Li}{1} 6708\,\AA\ doublet is well-defined.
We therefore numerically integrate a single best-fit Gaussian over a
local window, and estimate the uncertainties on the line width through
a Monte Carlo procedure that bootstraps against the local scatter in the
continuum.
Generally speaking, this approach does not correct for the neighboring
\ion{Fe}{1} 6707.44\,\AA\ blend.

To evaluate the accuracy and precision of our equivalent measurement
technique, after applying an initial iteration on the
\nplhoststarwgyroagewithgrazingandhighruwe\ aforementioned stars,
we compared our lithium equivalent widths
with those reported by \citet{Berger_2018}.
For the \nbergeroverlap\ stars in both samples, we found {\bf X, Y,
Z.}

To calculate lithium ages, we use a combination of \texttt{EAGLES}
\citep{Jeffries_2023} and \texttt{BAFFLES}
\citep{Stanford-Moore_2020}.
The former tool was calibrated on stars observed by the Gaia-ESO
spectroscopic survey in 52 open clusters, with ages spanning 2 to
6{,}000\,Myr.  
Example \texttt{EAGLES} isochrones, as well as the modelled intrinsic dispersion
about those isochrones, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:li_vs_teff}.
While our preference would have been to exclusively use
\texttt{EAGLES} due to its homogeneous analysis approach ...

Sun-like stars, and decreases for older ages
\citep{2022ApJ...937...94M}.
Both the stellar and planetary samples point toward a star formation
rate in the Kepler field that has slowed over the past few gigayears.

Kroupa (2002a), using stellar kinematics, found the SFH to behave similarly. The relative maximum of the SFR that we find at 2–3 Gyr ago is compatible with the results of Vergely et al. (2002) and Cignoni et al. (2006) that, using Hipparcos data in a sphere of 80 pc around the Sun and assuming a fixed IMF, found maximum peaks at 1.75–2 Gyr ago and 2–3 Gyr ago, respec- tively. Recently, Bernard (2018), in a tentative work using TGAS data, pointed towards the existence of a relative maximum also located 2–3 Gyr ago."

Imagine we were to group stars between 0-1\,Gyr, 1-2\,Gyr, and
2-3\,Gyr, and label them ``young'', ``intermediate-age'', and ``old''.
A simple counting exercise from the distributions in
Figure~\ref{fig:hist_tgyro} tells us that there are \ratioobtoybstars\
times as many old stars in the Kepler field as young stars.
Similarly, there are \ratioobtoybplanets\ times as many old planet
hosts as young planet hosts. 

In terms of detected planet counts, our rotation-based ages for
the Kepler sample yield \{\nplyounggyro, \nplmidgyro, \nploldgyro\}
detected planets in the 0-1\,Gyr, 1-2\,Gyr, and 2-3\,Gyr bins.
For the sub-gigayear bin in particular, which holds specific weight in
studies of planet evolution, while there are \nplyounggyro\ planets
with median ages below 1\,Gyr, requiring $t_{\rm
gyro}$$<$1\,Gyr at 2$\sigma$ confidence yields
\nplyounggyrotwosigma\ planets orbiting \nplhostsyounggyrotwosigma\
stars.
The stellar and planetary properties of this latter sample of young
planets are given in Table~\ref{tab:youngplanets}.

Given that the history of young exoplanet discovery includes a
sociological tendency to report detailed descriptions of specific
young exoplanets, we find it necessary to briefly discuss the
properties of at least the most notable members of the set of
confirmed planets that have well-measured ages.
We first focus on systems reported to be in the four stellar
ensembles in the Kepler field that have yielded transiting planets:
Cep-Her, MELANGE-3, Theia~520, and NGC~6811.
We then consider the broader set of Kepler planets that are young
based on the rotational and lithium-based properties of their host
stars.


\subsubsection{Planets in Clusters}
\label{subsec:clusterplanets}

\paragraph{Cep-Her}
Kepler-1627Ab, Kepler-1643b, Kepler-1974b and Kepler-1975\,Ab are
known members of the $\approx$40\,Myr old Cep-Her association
\citep{Bouma_2022a,Bouma_2022b}.  The age of various sub-components of
this association are best measured through relative isochronal
placement of the pre-main-sequence \citep[see][]{Bouma_2022b}, and
gyrochronology of stars in these clusters show them to be $<$100\,Myr
old.  The planets themselves are all on close-in orbits (5-25\,days),
with sizes from 2-4\,$R_\oplus$.  For Kepler-1627A and Kepler-1974,
the rotation, lithium, and cluster-based ages all agree within
1$\sigma$.  For Kepler-1643, while the rotation and cluster ages agree
($46^{+9}_{-7}$\,Myr; \citealt{Bouma_2022b}), the lithium-based age
($198^{+98}_{-76}$\,Myr) is 2.0$\sigma$ above the nominal cluster age
for RSG-5.  For Kepler-1975Ab (KOI\,7913Ab), the lithium age may be
similarly ``old'', though with less confidence due to the large
intrinsic scatter in K dwarf lithium calibration measurements.  For
that system, the isochronal age of its binary companion provides a
more stringent and serendipitous constraint on the $\approx$40\,Myr
age.

\paragraph{MELANGE-3}
\citet{2022AJ....164...88B} described an association in the Kepler
field that was argued to be $105\pm10$\,Myr based on a combination of
rotation, lithium, and the isochronal pre-main-sequence.  Kepler-970
and Kepler-1928 harbor two transiting mini-Neptunes inside this
association \citep{2022AJ....164...88B}.  Our rotation-based
age-dating independently recovers these systems, with $t_{\rm
gyro}=176_{-40}^{+120}$\,Myr and $144_{-88}^{+104}$\,Myr for
Kepler-970 and -1928 respectively.  The former rotation-based age
being slightly older than the suggested Pleiades age for the
assocation agrees with Figure~4 of \citet{2022AJ....164...88B}, where
the MELANGE-3 rotational isochrone is visually slower than
the corresponding Pleiades track.

\paragraph{Theia~520}
Kepler-968 and Kepler-52 both have rotation-based ages of
330-350\,Myr.  These stars were independently reported by
\citet{2019AJ....158..122K} to be members of an association dubbed
Theia~520 based on their spatial and kinematic correlations with
nearby stars.  While the core of this structure was previously named
UBC-1 \citep{2018A&A...618A..59C}, both Kepler planet hosts are in
more diffuse regions of the cluster reported by
\citet{2019AJ....158..122K}, so we adopt the name from the latter
study.  The nominal age of Theia~520 reported by
\citet{2019AJ....158..122K} based on isochrone fitting was
$247^{+64}_{-51}$\,Myr.  An independent analysis of the cluster's core
by \citet{2024A&A...681A..13F} using g-mode asteroseismology,
gyrochronology, and isochrone fitting found consistent results.
Ongoing spectroscopic and rotation-based studies of the broader
cluster by J.~Curtis et al.~ is broadly that the two planet-hosting
stars are indeed members of this diffuse population.  Given the broad
set of both cluster-level and individual-star evidence, this makes
Kepler-968 and Kepler-52 the youngest multiplanet systems that have
currently been identified from the Kepler primary mission.
We leave detailed discussion of the planet's properties to the latter 
group.

\paragraph{NGC~6811}
\citet{Meibom_2013} reported the discovery of Kepler-66 and -67b, two
mini-Neptunes in NGC~6811 ($\approx$1\,Gyr).
We report rotation-based ages for these systems of
$1419^{+657}_{-353}$\,Myr and $873.75\pm{112}$\,Myr respectively.
For Kepler-66, $T_{\rm eff}$=5898\,K, and $P_{\rm
rot}$=10.25$\pm$0.10\,days.
{\it LGB TODO: check again after dereddening...}



\subsubsection{Systems with Rotation and Lithium in Agreement}
%
Whenever both rotation and lithium find a star to be in a
narrowly-constrained age range, confidence in the true age greatly
increases, due to the independence of the two measurement techniques.
The empirical precision for the inferred ages as a function of $P_{\rm
rot}$, $EW_{\rm Li}$, and $T_{\rm eff}$ has been mapped out by
\citet{Bouma_2023} and \citet{Jeffries_2023} for rotation and lithium
respectively.  The region of greatest overlap is dictated by the
timescale for lithium depletion: for stars with temperatures between
4500-5500\,K with ages $\lesssim$500\,Myr, we can hope to obtain
independent two-sided constraints.

The youth of most of these systems, to our knowledge, is being
well-constrained for the first time in this work.  Here we limit
discussion to systems with $t_{\rm gyro}$$<$500\,Myr not in the clusters
mentioned above.

The new young planets
include five 1.8-3.8\,$R_\oplus$ mini-Neptunes
(Kepler-1529b $\approx$100\,Myr,
-1521b $\approx$195\,Myr,
-1467b $\approx$235\,Myr,
-955b $\approx$400\,Myr, and
-523b $\approx$440\,Myr),
a single Neptune-sized planet
(Kepler-971b $\approx$335\,Myr),
five 1.1-1.8\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths
(Kepler-1930b $\approx$150\,Myr,
-1313b $\approx$185\,Myr,
-1565b $\approx$205\,Myr,
-1532b $\approx$400\,Myr,
-1481b $\approx$400\,Myr),
and three Earth or sub-Earth-sized planets
(Kepler-1933b $\approx$300\,Myr,
-1561b $\approx$420\,Myr,
-1482b $\approx$490\,Myr).
All of these planets are on orbital periods below 50\,days.

Of these planets, one specific highlight is Kepler-1933b, a 4.9\,day
1.0\,$R_\oplus$ Earth-sized planet.  Its rotation-based age of
$304^{+96}_{-112}$\,Myr agrees within $1\sigma$ of its lithium age,
though at half the relative uncertainty.  Based on these lines of
evidence, this system may be the youngest Earth-sized planet known,
comparable to systems such as HD~63433d \citep[1.1\,$R_\oplus$,
$414\pm23$\,Myr][]{2024AJ....167...54C}.

A less clear case is Kepler-447b, which is supposedly a 32\,$R_\oplus$
planet on a 7.8\,day grazing orbit.  Rotation and lithium independently
find a 420-440\,Myr age.  {\it LGB TODO What is up with the size?}.

%  Kepler-1529b, a 5.3\,day 2.0\,$R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune is $\approx$100\,Myr old.
%  Kepler-1930b, a 13.0\,day 1.5\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earth on a grazing orbit is $\approx$120-180\,Myr old.
%  Kepler-1313b, doubly unlucky, a 3.8\,day 1.7\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earth on a grazing orbit is $\approx$185\,Myr old.
%  Kepler-1521b, a 47.2\,day 2.3\,$R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune is 180-210\,Myr old.
%  Kepler-1467b, a 47.1\,day 3.1\,$R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune is 230-240\,Myr old.
%  Kepler-1565b, a 1.5\,day 1.3\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earth is 180-230\,Myr old.
%  Kepler-971b, a 9.6\,day 3.9\,$R_\oplus$ Neptune-sized planet is 300-370\,Myr old.
%  
%  Kepler-1933b is a 4.9\,day 1.0\,$R_\oplus$ Earth-sized planet.  Its
%  rotation-based age of $304^{+96}_{-112}$\,Myr agrees within $1\sigma$ of
%  its lithium age, though at half the relative uncertainty.  Based on
%  these lines of evidence, this system may be the youngest Earth-sized
%  planet known, comparable to systems such as HD~63433d
%  \citep[1.1\,$R_\oplus$, $414\pm23$\,Myr][]{2024AJ....167...54C}.
%  
%  Kepler-1532b is a 1.1\,day 1.3\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earth.  Rotation points to a $\approx$400\,Myr age, and lithium is consistent.
%  Kepler-955b is a 14.5\,day 2.7\,$R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune.  Rotation points to a $\approx$400\,Myr age, and lithium is consistent.
%  Kepler-1481b, a 5.9\,day 1.1\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earth has a
%  rotation-based age of $\approx$400\,Myr, and a $2\sigma$ lithium
%  detection that, upon visual inspection of the spectrum, is
%  believeable.  The implied lithium age is marginally consistent with
%  the rotation-based age, although perhaps with some tension.
%  Kepler-447b is supposedly a 32\,$R_\oplus$ planet (grazing) on a
%  7.8\,day grazing orbit.  Rotation and lithium independently find a
%  420-440\,Myr age.
%  Kepler-1561b is a 0.9\,$R_\oplus$ sub-Earth, on a 1.0\,day orbit.
%  Rotation points to a 420\,Myr age.  The detected EW$_{\rm Li}$ is
%  consistent, although given the star's temperature, not particularly
%  constraining.
%  The same is true for the 1.9\,$R_\oplus$ and 5.8\,day super-Earth Kepler-523b, and the 
%  1.0\,$R_\oplus$, 12.2\,day Earth-sized Kepler-1482b.



\subsubsection{Systems with Rotation and Lithium in Disagreement}

For Kepler-957, $T_{\rm eff}$=4947\,K, and $P_{\rm rot}$=4.52\,days,
This implies a rotation-based age of $96_{-72}^{+192}$\,Myr.  The
rotational broadening of the spectrum ($v\sin
i$$\approx$9.8$\pm$1.0\kms) is consistent with the nominal stellar
rotation period.  However, if this star were $\lesssim$500\,Myr old,
lithium should have been detectable at $>$50\,m\AA.  Lithium is
marginally if at all present in the spectrum ({\bf  EW$_{\rm
Li}$$<$XX\,m\AA at 2$\sigma$ }).  While the planet (nominally
6.9\,$R_\oplus$ on a 5.9\,day orbit) has been statistically validated
\citep{Morton_2016}, inspecting the data validation reports this is
somewhat surprising.  The light curve shows greater scatter in-transit
than out of transit, appears near-grazing, and has a suggestion of a
strong odd-even depth difference.  This is a surprising system that
merits further attention.

\subsubsection{Other Notables}

Kepler~221 is a 633$^{+120}_{-112}$\,Myr four-planet system.

Kepler~51 (CITE Masuda2014) has previously been noted for its bizarre architure.
The rotation-based age we find here is higher/lower than previously noted.

Kepler~411, a $\approx$780$\pm$170\,Myr early K dwarf with three
transiting planets at 3.0, 7.8, and 58\,days, has a rare
architecture.  \citet{2019A&A...624A..15S} conducted a transiting
timing analysis of the system, confirming Kepler-411d and arguing for
the presence of a fourth non-transiting planet, Kepler-411e, based on
the TTVs seen in Kepler-411d and assuming that the system is nearly
coplanar.  Regarding the stellar age, \citet{2019A&A...624A..15S} used
the \citet{2007ApJ...669.1167B} relation and the measured rotation
period, which yielded an estimate of 212$\pm$31\,Myr.  However, the
star's temperature ($\approx$4900\,K) puts it in a regime where the
\citeauthor{2007ApJ...669.1167B} relation has been known to not fit
observations for quite some time
\citep[e.g.][Fig.~9]{2008ApJ...687.1264M}.  Our adopted age of
$\approx$780$\pm$170\,Myr agrees with the open cluster calibrators.

Kepler-63b is interesting in that it is {\it missing} from our
catalog.  This 6.1\,$R_\oplus$ ``sub-Saturn'' has been shown to be in
a polar orbit based on both the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and a
starspot-crossing analysis \citep{2013ApJ...775...54S}.  With $T_{\rm
eff}=5576\pm50$\,K, and a rotation period of 5.40\,days, we calculate
a rotation-based age of $t_{\rm gyro}$=$251^{+80}_{-90}$\,Myr,
qualitatively consistent with the estimates from
\citet{2013ApJ...775...54S}, though with larger uncertainties because
our age accounts for the intrinsic scatter in the open cluster
calibration sequences \citep{Bouma_2023}.  
While the usual catalogs (\citetalias{Santos_2019},
\citetalias{Santos_2021}, \citetalias{McQuillan_2014}, and
\citetalias{Mazeh_2015}) do not report this star's rotation period.
\citetalias{Santos_2021} flagged the system as ``potentially'' having
rotation-based modulation.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

\subsection{``Galactic Archaeology'' Comparison}
Zasowski et al fitted a chemical-isochrone model to APOGEE, X, Y, Z
data and presented a model for the star formation history of the MW.
The gist is a spike at z=2, and a gradual decrease since then, by
about a few of ten.

Mor2019 did isochrone fitting to Gaia, and found the same, but with a
spike at 3Gyr.

Our inferred gyro-age distribution of the Kepler field seems to agree
with these pictures.  The main value added is likely over the first
gigayear.

\subsection{Gyrochronal Age Comparison}
Searching the literature for gyrochronal analyses of the Kepler field,
the most relevant studies seemed to be those of
